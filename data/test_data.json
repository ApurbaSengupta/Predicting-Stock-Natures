REUTERS/Mike Segar  Apple said it had appointed Oliver Schusser as vice president of Apple Music and international content. Schusser, who joined Apple 14 years ago, will report directly to Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue and will also oversee Apple\u2019s services outside the United States, including the App Store and iTunes.  Apple\u2019s top streaming music rival Spotify Technology SA has 71 million so-called premium subscribers, a figure that includes users who have given the company a credit card number for a free trial. Spotify became a public company earlier this month after holding a so-called direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange.  On a comparable basis, the Apple Music service has 48 million subscribers, 40 million of whom are paying subscribers and 8 million of whom are on a free trial, Apple said. Both firms charge $9.99 a month for streaming music but provide discounts for student and family plans.  Variety magazine earlier reported the new subscriber figures and Schusser\u2019s promotion. He previously built up Apple\u2019s services businesses outside the U.S. in 155 markets, including China, Japan and Latin America, Apple said.  Apple\u2019s services business, which includes Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud, is becoming increasingly important to the Apple\u2019s financial outlook because the smart phone market has matured and iPhone sales growth has slowed. In its most recent quarter, Apple\u2019s services business grew 18 percent to $8.4 billion, missing analyst expectations of $8.6 billion.

The EU decision is the latest in a series by global regulators that have amounted to billions of dollars in fines and require changes in Qualcomm business. The contract at issue with Apple is no longer in force, and Qualcomm already faces more competition from Intel and other rivals.  Still, the EU decision could make Qualcomm more vulnerable to chipmaker Broadcom Ltd\u2019s $103 billion hostile bid, since Broadcom argues it can smooth rocky relations with customers such as Apple..  Qualcomm said it would appeal the decision immediately.  The European Commission said its investigation, launched in 2015, covered the period from 2011 to 2016 and took into account Qualcomm\u2019s market dominance in LTE baseband chipsets, which enable rapid mobile broadband connections.  \u201cQualcomm paid billions of U.S. dollars to a key customer, Apple, so that it would not buy from rivals. These payments were not just reductions in price \u2013 they were made on the condition that Apple would exclusively use Qualcomm\u2019s baseband chipsets in all its iPhones and iPads,\u201d European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.  \u201cThis meant that no rival could effectively challenge Qualcomm in this market, no matter how good their products were,\u201d she said.  The fine represented 4.9 percent of Qualcomm\u2019s 2017 turnover, the Commission said.  Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement that the company believed its agreement with Apple did not violate EU rules. \u201cWe have a strong case for judicial review and we will immediately commence that process,\u201d he said.  Qualcomm\u2019s shares were down 1.35 percent at $67.42 in midday trade, and analysts saw the fine as good for Broadcom\u2019s approach.  \u201cWhile Qualcomm believes they are in a temporary (albeit perfect) storm of customer and regulatory issues, Broadcom believes that the current problems are a harbinger of further headwinds to come,\u201d Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein, said in a note to clients Wednesday. \u201cAnd this latest finding continues to support the idea that regulators remain unhappy with the current state of affairs.\u201d  Despite levying fines, EU antitrust regulators recently cleared Qualcomm\u2019s $38 billion bid to buy NXP Semiconductors. Chinese regulators still need to approve the deal, and some NXP shareholders want a higher price.  Qualcomm is required to post a bond for the fine while the appeal unfolds, which will likely result in a charge for the current quarter. When hit with fines in the past, such as $774 million levy last year from Taiwanese regulators, Qualcomm took a charge as it appealed.  RELATIONS WITH APPLE STRAINED  Vestager told a news conference there would be no repercussions for Apple in the case.  EU antitrust regulators have come under pressure after European judges sent a case against U.S. chipmaker Intel back to an EU court for an appeal. Intel was fined 1 billion euros in 2009 for paying computer makers to buy most of their chips from them.  Google has also appealed against a record 2.4 billion euro fine for giving prominent placements in searches to its shopping service and demoting rival offerings.  This is the Commission\u2019s first decision on market abuse since the Intel ruling last September. Vestager said the ruling had given guidance on how to prove its case.  \u201cWe have carefully examined the ruling and the evidence in our case to make sure that our decision fully complies with the guidance given by the court,\u201d she said.  Apple and Qualcomm are meanwhile locked in a wide-ranging legal battle over Qualcomm\u2019s business practices, which started a year ago with Apple suing Qualcomm for nearly $1 billion in patent royalty rebates that the chipmaker allegedly withheld from the phone maker.  Other regulators, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, are also investigating Qualcomm\u2019s dealings with Apple. The EU competition enforcer is expected to rule in the coming months against Qualcomm in another case involving British phone software maker Icera, which was later acquired by Nvidia Corp, a person familiar with the matter has told Reuters.  In that case, Qualcomm is accused of selling chipsets below cost to drive out Icera - a practice known as predatory pricing.

At the meeting, shareholders defeated two shareholder proposals, one asking that rules allowing shareholders to nominate directors to the board be eased, and another asking for a human rights committee at Apple.  The proxy access measure asked Apple to reconsider its rules for shareholders to nominate directors; the rules say that a group of no more than 20 shareholders must hold 3 percent of Apple\u2019s stock in order to nominate a director for one of the eight director positions. The proposal did not pass, with 67.8 percent of shareholders voting against it.  Another proposal urged Apple to create a human rights panel to oversee issues such as workplace conditions and censorship in China and to report results back to the public. The proposal was defeated, with 94.4 percent of shareholders voting against it.  Apple had recommended that shareholders vote against both of the measures.

John Gerzema, CEO of the Harris Poll, told Reuters in an interview that the likely reason Apple and Google fell was that they have not introduced as many attention-grabbing products as they did in past years, such as when Google rolled out free offerings like its Google Docs word processor or Google Maps and Apple\u2019s then-CEO Steve Jobs introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad.  \u201cGoogle and Apple, at this moment, are sort of in valleys,\u201d Gerzema said. \u201cWe\u2019re not quite to self-driving cars yet.

Gerzema attributed Amazon\u2019s ranking to its expanding footprint in consumers\u2019 lives into areas like groceries via its Whole Foods acquisition.  Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla climbed from No. 9 to No. 3 on the strength of sending Tesla Roadster into space aboard a SpaceX rocket - despite fleeting success delivering cars on time on earth, Gerzema said.  \u201cHe\u2019s a modern-day carnival barker - it\u2019s incredible,\u201d Gerzema said of Musk. \u201cThis \u2018The Right Stuff\u2019 attitude is able to capture the public\u2019s imagination when every news headline is incredibly negative.

(For graphic on Market Capitalization: Apple vs Amazon.com vs Alphabet, click: reut.rs/2Fn9hzA)  Amazon\u2019s stock has surged 83 percent over the past year, bolstered by scorchingly fast revenue growth as more shopping moves online and businesses shift their computing operations to the cloud, where Amazon Web Services leads the market.  In January, Amazon announced that it, Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co would form a company to cut health care costs for their employees, which was widely seen as a threat to the existing U.S. healthcare system and underscored Amazon\u2019s ability to disrupt markets.  Amazon dislodged Microsoft Corp as the No. 3 U.S. company by market capitalization in February.  At $783 billion, Alphabet Inc has the second largest market capitalization. The Google parent company\u2019s stock has grown about 33 percent over the past year, faster than Apple but far slower than Amazon.  Meanwhile, optimism about Apple\u2019s iPhone X has given way to concerns that demand for the $1,000 device may be weaker than expected.  To be sure, past stock gains are not a reliable predictor of future performance, and the surge in Amazon shares in recent years has been exceptional by most standards.  But if Amazon\u2019s stock were to keep growing on the trajectory seen over the past year, the company\u2019s market capitalization would hit $1 trillion in late August.

VirnetX\u2019s stock rose as much as 44 percent on the news in after hours trading. The company closed at $4.10 per share on Tuesday.  Apple\u2019s stock has seen little change on the news given that the $502.6 million award is minuscule compared to the company\u2019s profits. The company generated $20 billion profit in the first quarter, the company said in February.  VirnetX claimed that Apple\u2019s FaceTime, VPN on Demand and iMessage features infringe four patents related to secure communications, claims that Apple denied.  The dispute has bounced between the district court, patent office and Federal Circuit since 2010. There have been multiple trials, most recently one involving earlier versions of the Apple devices. A jury in that case awarded $302 million that a judge later increased to $439.7 million.  Kendall Larsen , CEO of VirnetX, said the damages, which were based on sales of more than 400 million Apple devices, were \"fair.\"  \"The evidence was clear,\" Larsen said after the verdict was announced. \"Tell the truth and you don\u2019t have to worry about anything.\"  Apple lawyers declined to comment.  For VirnetX, the jury verdict in its favor could be a short-lived victory. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board has said the patents are invalid, in cases that are currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington.  The Federal Circuit, which handles all patent appeals, declined to put this trial on hold, saying it was so far along that a verdict would come before a final validity decision.  VirnetX, based in Zephyr Cove, Nevada, reported just over $1 million in revenue last year but investors have boosted the stock by more than 70 percent in hopes of an eventual victory over Apple.  The company started within government contractor SAIC Inc., tasked with developing secure communications for the Central Intelligence Agency.

Big technology mergers involving startups with insignificant revenue usually fall through the EU\u2019s usual net for checking whether deals harm competition across the bloc. However, alarmed that it nearly missed Facebook Inc.\u2019s takeover of messaging service WhatsApp, the EU is seeking to change its rules to allow it to take charge of acquisitions where a target company makes no money but holds valuable technology or intellectual property.  Apple announced its purchase of the U.K.-based app in December, for a reported $400 million, according to people familiar with the transaction, which would make it one of Apple\u2019s largest acquisitions. The Shazam app uses the microphone on a smartphone or computer to identify almost any song playing nearby, then points users to places they can listen to it, such as Apple Music or Spotify Ltd.  The acquisition would help Apple embed that capability more deeply into its music offerings. The company\u2019s digital assistant Siri was integrated with Shazam in 2014, so users could ask it what song is playing in the background.  The EU may be worried that once Shazam is under Apple\u2019s control, the iPhone maker could choose to make Apple Music the only option for listening to tracks. That could divert some of the referrals from Shazam that currently go to London-based Spotify. The acquisition also gives Apple access to a large user data base of people\u2019s musical interests.  Apple hasn\u2019t indicated that it plans to make Shazam an exclusive for Apple Music, but in the past the company has sometimes made acquired features compatible only with its products. It also has sometimes kept support for properties it\u2019s bought, for example, when Cupertino, California-based Apple acquired Beats Music to develop Apple Music, Apple released an Android version of the program.  Apple said it would work with the EU on the matter, but declined to provide further detail.

That means the new positions created by Apple are likely to have a more significant political impact than its $38 billion tax payment, according to Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business.  \u201cThe thrust here is American jobs, jobs on American soil, build manufacturing here, don\u2019t build everything in China,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have an announcement of a million jobs. But you can have companies like Apple saying that we\u2019re going to have 20,000 new jobs here. If other companies say they\u2019re going to have new jobs too, it does add up.\u201d  For more on Apple, check out the Decrypted podcast:  Later Wednesday, Trump tweeted a response lauding Apple\u2019s announcement. \u201cI promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGreat to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS. Huge win for American workers and the USA!\u201d  Apple has the largest offshore cash reserves of any U.S. company, with about $252 billion at the end of September, the most recently reported fiscal quarter. The tax rate indicates that Apple is likely bringing back a majority of its overseas cash back to the U.S., leaving only a small portion for international investments like retail stores.  \u201cThey\u2019re going to have well over $200 billion by the end of this year that will be available for incremental investments, capital returns and M&A,\u201d said Matthew Kanterman, a New York-based Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. The new tax law lets U.S. companies bring overseas cash reserves back home in one year and pay the resulting tax bill over eight years. \u201cAnd Apple hasn\u2019t historically done big M&A,\u201d he said.  Five-Year Spending Plan  The $30 billion in capital expenditures will come as part of $350 billion that Apple expects to spend in the U.S. over the next five years. The 20,000 new jobs include additional Apple employees at its campuses, data centers, and retail stores, but not third-party developers for iPhone and Mac apps, an economy Apple has touted in the past.  Apple said that part of the $30 billion in capital expenditures will go toward a new U.S.-based campus, new data centers and additional supplier investments. The company, which opened a new headquarters in Cupertino last year, said its new U.S. site initially will be focused on employees who provide technical support to Apple product users. The new location, which Apple said it will announce later this year, will be similar to the company\u2019s existing campus in Austin, Texas, for supply-chain and technical-support employees.  Can This Tax Proposal Lure Companies and Cash Home?: QuickTake  Apple said it will increase its local manufacturing fund, announced last year, from $1 billion to $5 billion, indicating that it will be sourcing more components for its products domestically. As part of the original fund, Apple invested in Corning Inc. and Finisar Corp., companies that make components for iPhone glass screens and lasers for Face ID and AirPods, respectively.  \u201cThese are probably many capital expenditure initiatives and new site build-outs that Apple was already planning on doing regardless of repatriation,\u201d said Michael Olson, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock.  \u201cWhat\u2019s not said in this release is that there is more potential for increased buybacks for shareholders and acquisitions that might not have taken place if it were not for the cash influx from overseas,\u201d Olson said. Apple typically provides updates on its share buyback program when it announces second quarter earnings.  \u2014 With assistance by Alexis Leondis", "stock": "AAPL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-17", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-17/apple-expects-38-billion-tax-bill-on-overseas-repatriated-cash"}, {"article": "Two pairs of Beats headphones.

That has involved IBM sharing its enterprise expertise with Apple and Apple sharing its design sense with IBM. The companies have actually built hundreds of enterprise apps running on iOS devices. Today, they took that friendship a step further when they announced they were providing a way to combine IBM Watson machine learning with Apple Core ML to make the business apps running on Apple devices all the more intelligent.  The way it works is that a customer builds a machine learning model using Watson, taking advantage of data in an enterprise repository to train the model. For instance, a company may want to help field service techs point their iPhone camera at a machine and identify the make and model to order the correct parts. You could potentially train a model to recognize all the different machines using Watson\u2019s image recognition capability.  The next step is to convert that model into Core ML and include it in your custom app. Apple introduced Core ML at the Worldwide Developers Conference last June as a way to make it easy for developers to move machine learning models from popular model building tools like TensorFlow, Caffe or IBM Watson to apps running on iOS devices.  After creating the model, you run it through the Core ML converter tools and insert it in your Apple app. The agreement with IBM makes it easier to do this using IBM Watson as the model building part of the equation. This allows the two partners to make the apps created under the partnership even smarter with machine learning.  \u201cApple developers need a way to quickly and easily build these apps and leverage the cloud where it\u2019s delivered. [The partnership] lets developers take advantage of the Core ML integration,\u201d Mahmoud Naghshineh, general manager for IBM Partnerships and Alliances explained.  To make it even easier, IBM also announced a cloud console to simplify the connection between the Watson model building process and inserting that model in the application running on the Apple device.  Over time, the app can share data back with Watson and improve the machine learning algorithm running on the edge device in a classic device-cloud partnership. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of this combination. As you run the application, it\u2019s real time and you don\u2019t need to be connected to Watson, but as you classify different parts [on the device], that data gets collected and when you\u2019re connected to Watson on a lower [bandwidth] interaction basis, you can feed it back to train your machine learning model and make it even better,\u201d Naghshineh said.  The point of the partnership has always been to use data and analytics to build new business processes, by taking existing approaches and reengineering them for a touch screen.  \u201cThis adds a level of machine learning to that original goal moving it forward to take advantage of the latest tech. \u201cWe are taking this to the next level through machine learning. We are very much on that path and bringing improved accelerated capabilities and providing better insight to [give users] a much greater experience,\u201d Naghshineh said.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-20", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/03/19/apple-ibm-extend-partnership-with-watson-core-ml-coupling/"}, {"article": "Apple is planning to use its own chips for its Mac devices, which could replace the Intel chips currently running on its desktop and laptop hardware, according to a report from Bloomberg.  Apple already designs a lot of custom silicon, including its chipsets like the W-series for its Bluetooth headphones, the S-series in its watches, its A-series iPhone chips, as well as customized GPU for the new iPhones. In that sense, Apple has in a lot of ways built its own internal fabless chip firm, which makes sense as it looks for its devices to tackle more and more specific use cases and remove some of its reliance on third parties for their equipment. Apple is already in the middle of in a very public spat with Qualcomm over royalties, and while the Mac is sort of a tertiary product in its lineup, it still contributes a significant portion of revenue to the company.  Creating an entire suite of custom silicon could do a lot of things for Apple, the least of which bringing in the Mac into a system where the devices can talk to each other more efficiently. Apple already has a lot of tools to shift user activities between all its devices, but making that more seamless means it\u2019s easier to lock users into the Apple ecosystem. If you\u2019ve ever compared connecting headphones with a W1 chip to the iPhone and just typical Bluetooth headphones, you\u2019ve probably seen the difference, and that could be even more robust with its own chipset. Bloomberg reports that Apple may implement the chips as soon as 2020.  Intel may be the clear loser here, and the market is reflecting that. Intel\u2019s stock is down nearly 8% after the report came out, as it would be a clear shift away from the company\u2019s typical architecture where it has long held its ground as Apple moves on from traditional silicon to its own custom designs. Apple, too, is not the only company looking to design its own silicon, with Amazon looking into building its own AI chips for Alexa in another move to create a lock-in for the Amazon ecosystem.

Baird & Company, wrote in a research report.  While Amazon\u2019s online store sales grew 20 percent from a year earlier, the company\u2019s total retail growth benefited from its acquisition of Whole Foods Markets. That deal, announced in June, added much of the $4.52 billion in physical store revenue for the quarter.  Yet the biggest revenue growth came from a category generically named \u201cother,\u201d which includes advertising services and rose 62 percent to $1.74 billion from a year earlier.  By far the most profitable big business for the company was Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing unit. Its revenue rose 45 percent to $5.11 billion, and its operating income increased 46 percent to $1.35 billion.  Amazon kept with its tradition of secrecy by refusing to reveal exactly how many of its Echo family of devices it sold, saying only that it sold \u201ctens of millions\u201d of them last year. The company priced the devices aggressively over the holidays \u2014 its cheapest was only $29. The devices probably did not yield much profit, though they are an important part of Amazon\u2019s effort to establish a technology ecosystem that could result in other benefits, such as enabling customers to make impulse purchases with their voices.  Photo  Apple, in contrast, is without equal in making profits from tech hardware.  For the company\u2019s fiscal first quarter, it reported a record for quarterly net income \u2014 $20.07 billion, up 12 percent from a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent to $88.3 billion. The gains were notable considering that Apple\u2019s fiscal first quarter was a week shorter than the previous year\u2019s 14-week fiscal first quarter.  While Amazon is content to price its devices near its costs for making them, Apple is known for charging a premium for its smartphones, tablets and computers. The iPhone X, which uses facial recognition to unlock the device, is the most expensive in its history, starting at almost $1,000.

Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on the company\u2019s earnings call.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Cook noted that the iPhone X was the company\u2019s top-selling phone in the quarter despite its November release, roughly a month and a half after Apple\u2019s other new iPhones.  The company sold 77.3 million iPhones over the quarter, which was down 1 percent from the longer quarter a year earlier. Yet revenue was higher largely because of the pricing of the new iPhones: In addition to introducing the iPhone X, Apple raised the price of the base model of its iPhone to $699, up from the $649 starting price for past iPhones.  Sales in its \u201cother products\u201d category, which includes the Apple Watch, grew 36 percent to $5.5 billion. Apple declined to disclose sales of the Apple Watch for competitive reasons, but Mr. Cook noted on the earnings call that revenue for the Apple Watch had grown 50 percent.  Apple also highlighted money generated from services, which include the App Store and Apple Music, with revenue rising 18 percent to $8.5 billion. Apple said the App Store continued to be the top destination for smartphone customers to buy apps.  Apple sold 13.2 million iPads, up 1 percent \u2014 notable because iPad sales declined for many consecutive quarters over the last few years. But Mac sales shrank about 5 percent to 5.1 million units.  Despite strong sales of the pricey iPhone X, some analysts remained concerned that its sales were slowing. Ahead of the earnings call, some news reports said Apple was slashing production of the iPhone X for the quarter that ends in March. The reports cited supply chain partners that said Apple had cut orders for parts.  But in years past, Apple has warned investors that activities of its complex supply chain were an unreliable metric for overall sales. The company also typically slows down iPhone production after the holiday quarter, which is the peak shopping season.  Last month, Apple also unveiled plans to bring the vast majority of its $252 billion in cash held abroad back to the United States, paying a one-time repatriation tax of $38 billion. Because the company had already earmarked $36.4 billion in anticipation that it would eventually have to pay taxes on its foreign earnings, Apple did not see much impact from the recent tax code changes.

Apple has some catching up to do. Mac laptops and iPads were once the dominant devices in American classrooms, but Google has shot past Apple with inexpensive laptops called Chromebooks. Google has also led the way in software products designed specifically for schools, with an app called Google Classroom that teachers use to take attendance, assign homework and do other tasks, among others.  Of the 12.4 million tablets and laptops shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States last year, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market, compared with a negligible share in 2012, according to IDC. In the same period, the share of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 22 percent from about half. And Microsoft Windows devices dropped to 18 percent from about 45 percent, IDC said.  School districts embraced Chromebooks because they were comparatively inexpensive and easy to use. Since the laptops were cloud-based, they could be shared among students who could pick up any device to get access to their documents. And school districts could use a software dashboard to manage thousands of devices at once. Districts that needed to institute online testing began buying Chromebooks in bulk.  Still, Apple generates the most revenue from school hardware sales in the United States, partly because its devices cost more. Of the $5.4 billion spent on school devices last year in the United States, Apple\u2019s iPads and laptops accounted for about $2.1 billion, followed by Chromebooks at $1.95 billion and Microsoft Windows devices at $1.35 billion, according to IDC.

The 84-year-old brick school\u2019s front lawn was swarmed with black-clad security guards, including two with bomb-sniffing dogs, and dozens of chipper greeters from Apple in yellow knit hats and green sweatshirts \u2014 Lane Tech\u2019s colors.  \u201cI can\u2019t let you in unless you\u2019re excited!\u201d one said as guests entered.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/technology/apple-classroom-ipad-google.html"}, {"article": "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt I would have made a quick profit if the Broadcom deal had gone through,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as a shareholder, I voted against it.\u201d  That\u2019s partly because, \u201cas a citizen, I didn\u2019t like the deal,\u201d he said. Broadcom typically slashes costs, especially research and development, and the company said it would do exactly that if it acquired Qualcomm. \u201cIn the long run that\u2019s not good for the country or for society,\u201d Mr. Dodson said.  He agreed with the Trump administration\u2019s assessment that, by cutting Qualcomm\u2019s research costs, Broadcom would be assisting Chinese rivals in the global race for dominance in 5G communications technology.  But as an investor, his reasoning can pretty much be reduced to one word: Apple.  Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm\u2019s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm\u2019s business model and Apple\u2019s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication.  Photo  If Qualcomm and Apple can just bury the hatchet, Mr. Dodson reasons, Qualcomm\u2019s revenues would soar, and its stock price would climb well past Broadcom\u2019s offering price of $79 a share. By Mr. Dodson\u2019s reckoning, once Apple resumes paying Qualcomm, the chip maker will be worth at least $84 a share, \u201cwhich is why Broadcom\u2019s offer didn\u2019t really engage my attention,\u201d he said.  That, however, is a big \u201cif,\u201d given the intractable positions both sides have staked out.  At the heart of the dispute is the way Qualcomm calculates the licensing fee it charges customers, which is a percentage of the cost of the net selling price of the entire handset \u2014 and not the price of the chip. That means that Apple, a high-cost producer whose iPhone X sells for as much as $1,000, has paid much higher licensing fees than low-cost competitors using exactly the same chip set.  Apple has called the arrangement an \u201cextortion scheme.\u201d It infuriates Apple that Qualcomm has, in effect, been subsidizing its low-cost competitors, including the very Chinese companies that Mr. Trump says he is so concerned about.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Qualcomm has countered that its intellectual property makes many of the iPhones\u2019 distinctive features possible, features that low-cost competitors haven\u2019t replicated, and therefore Qualcomm deserves a percentage of the cost of the entire device.  Mr. Dodson made little immediate headway when he met with a delegation of top Qualcomm officials late last month and pressed his case for a settlement with Apple. The officials, including the chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, and Paul Jacobs, a Qualcomm founder and, until recently, executive chairman, visited Mr. Dodson in San Francisco to make their case against the Broadcom bid.  In Mr. Dodson\u2019s account of the meeting, he urged the Qualcomm executives to settle with Apple rather than risk alienating it as a customer over the long term. But Qualcomm officials said that Apple was demanding more than they were prepared to give and that, on an engineering level, relations with Apple remained good. They assured him that eventually they would reach a settlement, revenues would normalize and Qualcomm stock would respond.

Still, \u201cI\u2019d like to see them budge\u201d on the licensing issue, Mr. Dodson said. \u201cI can see Apple\u2019s point.\u201d  But if Qualcomm stopped charging Apple a percentage of the device\u2019s cost, it would probably have to extend similar terms to all its major customers. It recently amended its agreement with Samsung without abandoning its approach to license fees. At the meeting, Qualcomm officials told Mr. Dodson they offered Apple similar terms, but Apple rejected them.  A Qualcomm spokeswoman declined to comment, as did an Apple spokeswoman.  Long-simmering tensions between Qualcomm and Apple reached a boiling point in 2016, when Qualcomm halted rebates it was giving Apple. Qualcomm claimed Apple had violated the terms of the rebate agreement by cooperating with South Korea\u2019s investigation into what Samsung and others said was exclusionary conduct by Qualcomm. Apple responded by withholding the license fees it paid manufacturers of iPhones, who in turn stopped passing on the payments to Qualcomm.  Photo  Lawsuits and counterclaims erupted, and Qualcomm reduced its revenue estimates by $500 million a year.  While Apple has continued to buy and deploy the latest Qualcomm chips, it also reached out to a rival chip maker, Intel, which began supplying an alternative to Qualcomm\u2019s chip for the iPhone 7. (That phone, the iPhone 8 and the X may contain either a Qualcomm or an Intel chip.)  Qualcomm claims that Apple has compromised the performance of Qualcomm-equipped handsets in order to mask their superiority over the Intel-equipped phones. (Both Intel and Apple have vehemently denied the claims.)  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Numerous lawsuits are now well underway in the United States, with some expected to go to trial later this year. Regulators in the European Union, Taiwan, South Korea and China have ruled that Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices are unlawful and have levied fines, decisions that Qualcomm is appealing. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is conducting its own investigation.  While armies of patent lawyers fight over the rival claims, investors have already rendered a verdict. Qualcomm shares, after peaking at more than $80 in 2014, dropped by nearly 50 percent, hitting a low of $44 in 2016.  Qualcomm\u2019s precipitous decline is what attracted Mr. Dodson\u2019s attention along with other so-called value investors, who look for stocks trading below their intrinsic value. He said his fund\u2019s average cost per share for its Qualcomm position was about $56, so the fund was still ahead even after the deal collapsed this week. On Thursday, Qualcomm was trading at around $60.  Still, Qualcomm\u2019s performance has knocked the Endeavor fund from its perch at the top of the Morningstar rankings. So far this year, it\u2019s 61st.  Now that Mr. Trump has rescued Qualcomm from the imminent threat of a Broadcom takeover, its financial prospects \u2014 and share price \u2014 will largely follow the twists and turns in the Apple standoff. While Mr. Dodson remains optimistic about the outcome, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s against all potential takeovers of Qualcomm.  Last week, there were rumors that Intel might launch a bid for Broadcom, which made Mr. Dodson wonder: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it bid for Qualcomm? If Intel bought it, Qualcomm would be in good hands.\u201d  \u201cAs a citizen, I\u2019d be very comfortable with that,\u201d he said.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-15", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/business/with-one-battle-over-a-bigger-one-looms-for-qualcomm-apple.html"}, {"article": "Ecommerce portal Flipkart has announced the Apple Days sale on its website, offering discounts and cashback offers on various products including iPhones, MacBooks, iPads and the Apple Watch Series.

In the former category, the HomePod is excellent, with amazing sound and incredibly intuitive set-up. But in the latter Siri is only middling in its implementation, and the fact that you're not able to break out of the Apple ecosystem for many key functions also rankles.  Apple\u2019s devices have evolved hugely over the last 15 years or so, changing the brand from the rebooted upstart that gave us the iPod to the consumer tech powerhouse of today.  The HomePod takes the name of that iconic portable device, but a decade and a half on we're faced with the same question posed by previous Apple gadgets: how much of a premium should you pay for owning a device that fits seamlessly into the Apple ecosystem?  Let's not forget that the HomePod is a late entry to the smart speaker game, but that\u2019s standard operating procedure for the Cupertino-based brand: let the rest of the industry stride ahead with a new form factor, identify the issues and then offer something that \u2018just works\u2019... and generally for a higher price than the competition.  That\u2019s what\u2019s happened with the HomePod, although not in quite the same way as before. There\u2019s no denying that the sound quality of Apple\u2019s speaker is top-notch, but in a marketplace where Amazon has such an entrenched smart speaker/voice assistant ecosystem and Google isn\u2019t far behind, can a great-sounding-but-imperfect device be worth buying?  The HomePod is understated in the house.  As intimated, the HomePod price isn't a cheap speaker \u2013 the price is a weighty $349 / \u00a3319 / AU$499, and the speaker began shipping on February 9 in selected territories.  That makes it one of the most expensive smart speakers on the market \u2013 and certainly the most expensive mainstream option \u2013 but Apple is hoping to justify that price by embedding Siri inside and offering premium-quality audio.  Set-up  By far the easiest smart speaker to set up  Capable of reading own surroundings  It's a heavy box to bring home...  The Apple HomePod is so, well, Apple in the way you\u2019ll use it. As with the AirPods, simply hold your phone near the unit and your handset will send over your Apple ID and Apple Music preferences, and fill in all the long-winded Wi-Fi passwords that you\u2019re proud you remember but thankfully don\u2019t have to type in.  The set-up process was only delayed for us by the fact that we needed to upgrade to iOS 11.2.5 on our iPhone, which is a prerequisite for making the speaker work.  That highlights one key thing about the HomePod: you\u2019ll need to have an iPhone or iPad to set it up in the first place.  It\u2019s hard to see why you\u2019d buy this speaker without owning one of those already, but it trims the target audience down right from the outset.  The speaker glows pleasantly during setup  However, the set-up process does highlight one of the nice features of the HomePod: the glowing light on the top (which turns into the multi-colored Siri logo when you\u2019re issuing commands to it later on).  The whole process is so swift though \u2013 compare it to the long-long-long-winded set-up process for the Amazon Echo or Sonos One \u2013 and you\u2019ll be so glad that you don't have to spend a minute wafting your iPhone around the room to calibrate the sound levels.  Holding your phone near the speaker calls up this box  Add to that further such conveniences in day-to-day use \u2013 if you need to use a new Wi-Fi network that's already set up on your phone, you just literally hold the phone nearby and it's done \u2013 and you can see how Apple has smashed the competition when it comes to ease of use, one of its real hallmarks.  The HomePod will actually just work out where it is within the room simply by playing some music \u2013 it\u2019ll assess its physical surroundings by hearing how the sound it emits bounces around, and if there\u2019s a wall behind it will send certain sections of what you\u2019re listening to that way, while the main vocals or instruments will fire forwards.  Seven steps and the speaker is ready to go.  If it's not adjacent to a wall then the HomePod will chuck the sound out in a 360-degree space, although in most cases we\u2019d imagine people would use the speaker up against a wall.  After that\u2019s all set up, you can leave the house with your iPhone and your family or housemates will still be able to use the speaker, although you can turn off \u2018personal requests\u2019 based on your information if you don\u2019t want other people meddling with your business.  (Thankfully you can also stop requests to the speaker messing with your music listening history \u2013 if you\u2019re trying to build decent automated playlists on Apple Music, your housemates playing Justin Bieber and Moana on repeat won\u2019t ruin everything.)  Design  Understated design  Much heavier than expected  If you\u2019re thinking of picking up the HomePod you may want to go with both hands to start with. That\u2019s because this speaker is incredibly dense, packing 2.5kg of weight into its 172mm (6.8-inch) high frame.  It feels a good deal heavier than it looks, and that\u2019s because there are so many speakers in there. We\u2019re talking a woofer and seven tweeters, each with its own amplifier, and six microphones spread around to help pick up your voice when you're hailing Siri.  And once its placement is locked in, you\u2019ll need to answer one more question: how are you going to run the power lead that comes out the back? It\u2019s the only wire on this device, and the only thing that resembles a port too. There\u2019s no other physical connectivity on offer, which sadly means no aux-in port for connecting up a record player or other device.  We do not recommend placing your HomePod in front of a fire for any length of time.  All you\u2019ve got is a squat little speaker covered in an \u2018acoustic mesh\u2019 that\u2019s designed to protect the device while letting out as much sound as possible. It looks as unremarkable as you\u2019d expect \u2013 there are no decorative flourishes here \u2013 and the only break in the mesh is on the top, where a round, reflective disc sits.  This is, as we've mentioned, where the glowing light pulses, signifying when Siri is listening and processing commands, and it's also where you'll find the plus and minus icons for adjusting the volume.  Pushing the speaker against a wall brings the best audio performance.  It\u2019s a shame there\u2019s no haptic feedback from the buttons, but given that most of the time you\u2019re going to be controlling the HomePod with your voice it's not a big deal.  The HomePod isn't the most aesthetically pleasing speaker out there, but it's attractive in its simplicity. Some might think that, for the price, it should be more striking, but the speaker is certainly well-made.  And be warned - the Apple HomePod can leave a white ring underneath if you leave it on certain surfaces (mostly more expensive, porous wood). Apple has acknowledged this and says it should wipe off, or disappear after a few days, but other claims state that it can leave a more permanent ring. Either way, think about where you place the speaker, as the vibration causes a reaction between the silicon base to the wood thanks to the deeper bass.  We had our speaker on a wooden surface in our testing, but it was a thinner (well, cheaper) wood, and found no example of the staining... but it seems that more porous, expensive veneers are those in danger.  In terms of processing, the HomePod is equipped with Apple\u2019s A8 chip, created to be used in the iPhone 6 from 2015. That may sound a little old, but given that it was designed to power a whole smartphone, it\u2019s actually quite a lot of power for \u2018only\u2019 a speaker, even one that\u2019s sending and receiving commands to and from the cloud on a regular basis.  Audio performance  Sublime audio performance  No Bluetooth streaming or aux input  The audio quality of the Apple HomePod is, to put it simply, premium. It fills a room easily, with clear separation between all elements of music tracks.  It's certainly at its best when placed against a wall, pulling apart the sounds well, with elements such as voices coming through with incredible breadth.  We're probably all used to hearing music of various quality throughout our day, from poor-quality headphones to whatever speakers our TV has, so using the HomePod will expose a lot of people who aren't audiophiles to new subtleties in music which they may not have heard before.  You can ask Siri to read the news or a message out when in the kitchen if you've got your hands full.  The bass, in particular, is strong, but like most sounds emanating from the speaker the audio is stable, with sharp notes clipping very well. Listening to electronica, in particular, offered a lot of clarity, while bass guitar sounds brought a slight reverberation to the sound \u2013 those with an untrained ear in particular will be blown away.  But it's the fusion of all this that's impressive \u2013 being able to hear thudding bass (a teeny bit too thudding at times, it has to be said) while at the same time being treated to crystal-clear vocals on top is a lovely experience.  Sometimes you'll feel that things can get a little mixed together \u2013 bass guitar can be a touch muddy, or something like a violin can be easily overpowered \u2013 but compared to a cheap, low-end speaker the quality is just miles and miles ahead.  The HomePod is loud too, with Siri asking if you definitely want to do that when you ask the speaker to play at full volume. And if there are any sound effects on a track, be it water splashing, rain or a faux-vinyl sound, the crispness again is amazing.  In fact, the audio quality is so good that the biggest criticism we can level at the audio capabilities of the speaker is how you interact with it. Saying \u2018Hey Siri\u2019 over and over to achieve anything irks, and if you\u2019re in a room with multiple people talking you\u2019ll need others to shush otherwise their words are easily picked up, leading to random songs being played.  The base of the speaker is on the only place you'll find an Apple logo  It would be nice to somehow have your intentions registered without the need for a key phrase.  Comparing the HomePod to the new Amazon Echo and the Sonos One, though, it bests both of them easily. Leaving aside the simple set-up, which is a godsend, the sound from Apple's speaker is the most expansive and clear... it just feels like there's more information flooding into your ears.  The Amazon Echo is obviously the lowest-quality of the three in terms of sound quality, but it's not terrible. Listen to it in isolation and you'll like how it sounds, especially for the price. But the HomePod just destroys it with the level of audio on offer, making music sound, well, 'proper'.  The Sonos One is understandably much closer to the HomePod when it comes to audio performance, but it's not quite as good \u2013 the only way we can describe it is as being 'narrower' in its sound, with the volume and breadth of the audio not matching Apple's efforts.  That's not to say the Sonos One's sound quality isn't hugely clear and evocative \u2013 it thoroughly is \u2013 but there's just more power and depth from the HomePod.  But now we get onto how you actually listen to things on the HomePod, and therein lies the rub. You need a subscription to Apple Music unless you just want to stream stuff from your iPhone \u2013 and even that can only be done using AirPlay.  We say 'only' because you can't stream over Bluetooth to the HomePod. That's not a massive issue if you'll only ever want to play audio from an Apple product, but if you've got something else that can be used to stream Bluetooth music you're out of luck.  Similarly, with no aux input you won't be able to use the premium sound of the HomePod to play your CDs, or your vinyl collection if you've jumped on that particular bandwagon.  We can see the argument for not offering Bluetooth streaming \u2013 despite there being a Bluetooth connection on board to enable the HomePod to talk to other smart home devices \u2013 but not having an aux input is a missed opportunity.  So, given the above, how are you supposed to get the most out of your HomePod? With the aforementioned Apple Music \u2013 meaning you're essentially going to need to pay $10 / \u00a310 a month to keep using your new speaker.  You'll barely use the volume buttons on the top of the speaker.  If you're already paying that, no problem \u2013 but if you're currently a Spotify user you won't be able to use that service without streaming it over your phone, which isn't ideal \u2013 you can still control the music using your voice in this mode, but it's a lot slower to respond.  The fact that you're pretty much locked to Apple Music makes it all the more curious that Apple doesn't have a lossless format, like Tidal, given that the HomePod is tailored for such high-end sound.  Perhaps that's coming in the future. Or perhaps Apple thinks the sound is good enough with what's there \u2013 and as we've said, it is great.  But the fact that you can only use Apple Music rankles, further highlighting how you need to be deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem to get proper use out of the HomePod.  Speaking of the future, when Apple debuts AirPlay 2 later in the year you\u2019ll be able to link two HomePods together to get stereo sound. We had a brief demo of this, and it sounds, well, pretty much like two speakers making more noise together. The quality was equally as high, just more spread out and that sounded better.  With AirPlay 2 you\u2019ll also be able to spread your sound to other speakers \u2013 not just HomePods \u2013 and other AirPlay 2-enabled devices around the house.  We tried it with the Apple TV, and while the sound was brilliant we had to dive into the settings every time to tell the TV to play the sound through the speaker. Having two HomePods proudly sitting either side of the screen and automatically playing the audio from Netflix or whatever would be great.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-12", "source": "techradar", "url": "http://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-homepod-review"}, {"article": "Apple CarPlay: everything you need to know  Years ago, no one minded if their car\u2019s dashboard only offered the most basic of digital information. There was a clock, for example, and if you were lucky you might have even be told what temperature it was outside.  But as smartphone technology improved, drivers quickly demanded more from their vehicles. After all, why should the phone in your pocket have a better screen and more responsive user interface than the one in your car, which cost considerably more?  To their credit, car manufacturers are faced with five, or even 10-year product cycles, so no matter how advanced their infotainment system looks at launch, it is bound to look dated well before the car gets its first facelift.  That\u2019s where Apple CarPlay comes in. Powered by your iPhone, CarPlay gives your car an interface which looks like iOS, but is simplified so it can be safely and legally used while driving.  Are you Android rather than iPhone? Then you'll need Android Auto  What is CarPlay?  In simple terms, CarPlay takes the user interface of your iPhone and puts it onto the infotainment screen of your car dashboard.  This means when your iPhone is plugged in, the car\u2019s own system is replaced by the iOS home screen, complete with app icons and a virtual home button.  CarPlay can be interacted with via whatever controls your car already has, whether that be a touch screen, buttons, knobs, voice or a combination of all of these.  CarPlay doesn\u2019t include every app on your smartphone, because playing PUBG on your car dashboard is clearly a disaster waiting to happen, and some elements of apps are replaced by voice and dictation.  For example, incoming iMessages and WhatsApp messages are read out to you by Siri instead of shown on the display.  The 2017 Hyundai Elantra supports CarPlay for under $20,000  Most cars require you to plug your iPhone into the USB port with a Lightning cable, but some newer models (like the latest BMW 5-Series) now support wireless CarPlay, which works via the car\u2019s Bluetooth connection.  This is more convenient, but you\u2019ll want to make sure your iPhone is sat on a wireless charger if using wireless CarPlay, as it can drain the battery quickly if you\u2019re streaming music over 4G and using the Maps app for navigation.  CarPlay is designed to remove the urge to take a quick look at your iPhone behind the wheel. It\u2019s safer, easier and more convenient - or that\u2019s the idea, anyway.  Which cars support Apple CarPlay?  As of March 2018, there are over 300 models of car with CarPlay available either standard or as a paid-for optional extra.  Some cars bundle CarPlay when you opt for the enhanced sound system, for example, or pick a higher level of cabin trim level.  Other manufacturers charge a premium for adding CarPlay on its own, and the price can vary significantly.  For example, Honda includes CarPlay as standard on some models, and Ford includes CarPlay with its \u00a3750 (around $1,000) Sync 3 system in the new Fiesta (along with a larger touch screen and six speakers).  At the other end of the scale, Ferrari charges a huge \u00a32,400 (around $3,000) for adding the software necessary to make it work.  We have included a list of manufacturers currently offering CarPlay at the end of this article. Although it doesn\u2019t include everyone just yet, you\u2019ll be doing well to name a car maker off the top of your head that doesn\u2019t offer CarPlay  Apple CarPlay aftermarket solutions?  If you\u2019re not in the market for a new car, you can still get some CarPlay in your life by installing an aftermarket stereo.  Manufacturers like Alpine, Clarion, JBL, JVC, Kenwood, Pioneer and Sony all sell car stereo systems with CarPlay, as well as other goodies like Android Auto, Bluetooth and DAB digital radio.  The JBL Legend CP100 with Apple CarPlay  Prices start at around \u00a3200 ($280, AU$360) for an entry-level unit from a company like Power Acoustik, and go beyond \u00a3500 ($700, AU$900) for a fold-out system from Pioneer.  What you need to know about these systems is that car stereos come in two sizes; single DIN and double DIN. Single DIN units are usually two inches tall, while double DIN means a system which is four inches tall.  The former, like the Pioneer AVH-Z7000DAB we referred to above, is a single DIN unit with a motorised screen which folds out of your dashboard. Modern cars with their curved dashboards tend to not cater for aftermarket stereos like these without modification to the dashboard - something which is generally not advisable.  Is my iPhone compatible with CarPlay?  If you\u2019re still rocking an old iPhone with a 30-pin connector, then you\u2019re out of luck; any model before the iPhone 5 does not work with CarPlay. No model of iPad or iPod Touch work with CarPlay.  But it also means a lot of iPhones do - and here they are:  iPhone 5  iPhone 5S  iPhone 5C  iPhone SE  iPhone 6  iPhone 6 Plus  iPhone 6S  iPhone 6S Plus  iPhone 7  iPhone 7 Plus  iPhone 8  iPhone 8 Plus  iPhone X  What does CarPlay look like?  CarPlay is designed to look a lot like iOS. Sure, the home screen background is made black and most of your apps are hidden from view, but CarPlay is still the bare bones of your iPhone.  The main screen shows a selection of apps like Phone, Music, Maps and Messages, along with the time, your phone\u2019s signal strength, and a virtual home button.  As you open and close apps, the most recent three appear at the side of the user interface nearest the steering wheel, making it easy to return to the map, for example, without taking your eyes off the road for more than a quick glance.  That really is the point of CarPlay; it offers access to your iPhone\u2019s core features without distracting you from driving.  That\u2019s why most apps are hidden, and why many employ Siri to read things out rather than letting you read them off the screen.  For example, open the Messages app and you\u2019ll see a list of the most recent people to chat with you, but when you tap on a name Siri reads out any unread messages, or asks if you\u2019d like to dictate a reply.  Notifications appear at the top of the screen as they do on your iPhone, but these are limited to apps which can be used by CarPlay. If your phone receives a breaking news alert from the BBC, for example, it won\u2019t show up.  CarPlay also employs several tricks to make you spend less time looking at it. If you scroll through the artists list in your Music app, the interface will start showing large letters instead of every artist. Scroll until you get to the right letter, then pick the artist you want.  The home screen also shows an app to tap on if you want to return to the car\u2019s own infotainment system.  To adjust the layout of apps on CarPlay you have to head into the Settings app on your iPhone itself (when it isn\u2019t connected to the car).  Tap General, then CarPlay, then the car you want to change the home page of, and move the apps around as you would on the home screen of the phone itself.  Third-party apps compatible with CarPlay:  WhatsApp  Spotify  Amazon Music  Google Play Music  iPlayer Radio  CBS Radio  Pandora  Slacker Radio  Tidal  Audible  NPR One  VOX  Clammr  Downcast  While this should cater for most people\u2019s music and messaging needs, mapping is an area where CarPlay could be vastly improved. Only Apple Maps works, so you won\u2019t be able to access Google Maps or Waze while on the move.

AAPL 0.34% said it will acquire Next Issue Media LLC and its digital-magazine-subscription service Texture, a product developed by top magazine companies that bundles together some 200 subscriptions into one monthly service.  The acquisition comes as Apple looks to beef up its services business, which includes music streaming and mobile payments.  Apple has set a goal of increasing total revenue from services to more than $40 billion by 2020. The company generated nearly $30 billion in services revenue in its fiscal year ended in September.  Apple typically takes a 15% cut of subscription services from publishers and content providers, including Netflix Inc. and HBO, if those subscriptions are purchased through the App Store.  Terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed. Next Issue Media and Texture are owned by Cond\u00e9 Nast, Meredith Corp. , Hearst Corp., Rogers Communications Inc. and KKR & Co.  The magazine industry for years has sought ways to transition from print to online, but has faced profound challenges competing with tech giants for digital ad dollars, while print ad revenue continues to decline.  Last year, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc. accounted for more than 63% of U.S. digital ad spending, according to eMarketer, while the magazine world has been buffeted by steady cutbacks and numerous rounds of consolidation.  Next Issue, which launched in 2009, was envisioned as a way for publishers to compete against tech titans like Apple, whose app store has come to dominate distribution in the digital publishing marketplace.  In a joint statement, Texture\u2019s key publishing investors said the sale was in line with the shifting marketplace the industry has faced.  \u201cThis new relationship with Apple not only will deliver new audiences and further the reach of our collective brands, but reflects the way consumers are engaging with media today as they look to discover content and subscribe with more convenience and ease,\u201d they said.

Market leaders Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% continued to sell Echo and Google Home devices during the holidays, while Apple worked on a rival product it said wasn\u2019t ready for sale.  Amazon was the first major tech company to enter the smart-speaker market in late 2014, opening a wide lead by selling more than 20 million Echos even before tallying sales for the recent Christmas season. Its hockey puck-sized Echo Dot is estimated to account for more than half of Amazon\u2019s speaker unit sales, largely because of its lower price, which dropped to $30 during the holidays before rising to $50.  The smart-speaker shipments world-wide are expected to rise more than 50% this year to 56 million units, according to the market researcher Canalys. The U.S. will account for more than half of those sales, it said.  At $349, the HomePod costs considerably more than Amazon\u2019s latest Echo and a Google Home, whose list prices are $100 and $129, respectively.  Apple has tried to differentiate its speaker by emphasizing sound quality, particularly when playing music, over the device\u2019s ability to perform tasks.

Real-estate private equity firm Walton Street Capital has hired Eastdil Secured to market the Norman Foster-designed Apple Store that opened last fall and has become a popular new attraction along the reinvigorated Chicago River waterfront.  Walton last year paid $370 million for the Apple Store, which at the time was under development, along with 401 N. Michigan Ave., the 35-story office and retail building next door.  Now the firm is hoping to sell the 20,000-square-foot Apple Store along with 10,000-square-feet of retail space in the office building for as much as $175 million, according to people familiar with the offering.  Walton would retain the office space. Real-estate investors often buy mixed-use properties and then split off the valuable retail space and sell it separately.  Eastdil and potential buyers of the Apple Store were having preliminary discussions last week at the global Mipim real estate conference in Cannes, France, according to people at the conference. Eric Mogentale, managing principal of Walton, declined comment.  The sale comes at a time when retail real-estate in general is under enormous pressure because of competition from online shopping and the contraction and failure of many big name retailers. Values of many malls and shopping centers have been falling.  Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO, attended the store opening. Photo: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News  But Apple Stores have long been the gold standard in the retail world because of the high traffic they attract. Not only do they ring up strong sales, but they also boost traffic and sales at neighboring stores.  A report by Green Street Advisors in 2016 found that average sales for 220 malls with Apple Stores came to $710 per square foot, compared with $630 per square foot for malls without Apple Stores. The study was based on a database that covered about 1,400 properties.  Apple is well aware of the power of its brand and uses it to negotiate low rents. The rent it is paying for the new Apple Store in Chicago is well below the average $400 to $500 per square foot being paid nearby along Michigan Avenue, in an upscale retail area known as the Magnificent Mile, said people familiar with the matter.  Apple began discussing the new Chicago store more than two years ago with Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who has made development of the Chicago River waterfront a big priority. More than $60 million was spent on the standalone store, which has a 32-foot-tall glass fa\u00e7ade and a thin carbon roof.  The project included the redevelopment of the surrounding plaza area so that now Michigan Avenue is linked to the riverfront by granite staircases on either side of the store. The plaza, once cut off from the water, now \u201cflows effortlessly down to the river,\u201d Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s chief design officer, said when the store opened.  The store opened in October in a ceremony attended by Mr. Emanuel and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook.  Apple officials describe the store as the company\u2019s most ambitious partly because of its design and its connection to the river. The store is also bringing in well-known professionals to teach Apple device users about the products, an experience that isn\u2019t available at most other Apple stores around the world.

Apple on Wednesday said an update to its operating system for iPhones and iPads this spring will include a new \u201cHealth Records\u201d feature that will import and store medical information covering allergies, conditions, immunizations, lab results, medications, procedures and vitals.  A dozen hospitals are participating, including Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles and Penn Medicine in Philadelphia.  The effort to securely simplify and democratize health records won\u2019t be easy, say physicians who watched Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google wrestle with similar efforts over the years.  Apple\u2019s late arrival to medical records, though, gives it advantages its rivals didn\u2019t enjoy, physicians say, including the benefits of more consolidated hospital networks and concentration among medical-record systems.  \u201cApple is in the right spot,\u201d said Eric Topol, author of \u201cThe Creative Destruction of Medicine\u201d and a physician at the nonprofit Scripps Research Institute. \u201cThere\u2019s a long ways to go still,\u201d he said.  Starting in 2011, the U.S. government spent an estimated $40 billion in stimulus money on health-care information technology, according to McKinsey, encouraging doctors and hospitals to install electronic-medical-records systems and triggering a massive shift toward electronic health information.  Apple said it has secured participation from two of the U.S.\u2019s largest medical-records providers, Epic Systems Corp. and Cerner Corp., which account for more than 50% of medical-records management, as well as Athenahealth Inc., ATHN -1.51% which accounts for almost 2%, according to KLAS Research, which analyzes the industry.  But Apple needs to get more hospitals to share data in order for the Health Records feature to be valuable, said Noga Leviner, co-founder of PicnicHealth, a startup that helps patients consolidate their medical records.  Some hospitals in the same system use different variations of electronic medical records\u2014even from the same provider\u2014and oftentimes don\u2019t have agreements to share data, Ms. Leviner said. People want complete medical-records information\u2014not just records from only one of their six doctors, she said.  \u201cThe government spent $40 billion on this and they failed\u201d to bring those hospitals together, Ms. Leviner said.  Another challenge: expanding information beyond simple listings such as allergies and recent lab results, she said. Tens of millions of Americans with chronic conditions need far more detailed information, such as pathology reports for cancer patients or medical images for people with knee injuries.  Apple\u2019s push into medical records is its latest effort to break into the $3.2 trillion U.S. health-care market. Last year, the company announced its first medical study of heart rhythms using the Apple Watch and it launched HealthKit in 2014, providing a way for different health apps to share information.  HealthKit helped Apple earn the trust of physicians and hospitals since it includes standards that comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, said Richard Milani, a physician at Ochsner Health System in New Orleans who focuses on tech in health care, and works with Apple.  Dr. Milani said HealthKit helped create a secure system that can be used to transfer medical records to the Health Records feature. Apple said Health Records will encrypt patients\u2019 information to protect their privacy.  Apple also is adopting the leading standard for transferring electronic records known as the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, or FHIR, making it easier for hospitals and medical-records vendors to share information with the iPhone maker, he said.  Apple said it won\u2019t receive any health-record data. Instead, users will be able to add a health provider on their phone and import their records directly from the provider to the device. The company said the system is the same it uses for corporate email, allowing information to go from a corporate server directly to the phone without Apple ever seeing it.  Users will be able to back up their health records to iCloud, and that information will be encrypted with only users having the key to the data on their device.  Apple said it has no plans to monetize Health Records and designed the feature to create a better health experience for users.  Dr. Milani said the company has told hospitals the same thing. \u201cThe only way to monetize this is to say, \u2018We offer something a competitor doesn\u2019t offer to sell more devices,\u2019\u201d he said.  If it works, Health Records could ease a burden on patients, Dr. Milani said. He envisions a future where an iPhone user from Louisiana might be on vacation in Michigan and in need of medical treatment. Rather than the hospital having to look up that patient\u2019s records, the patient can pull them up on a phone.  \u201cThis is a consumer-empowerment move,\u201d Dr. Milani said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have all the information about you and you\u2019ll control it, and that\u2019s exactly who should control it.\u201d  Write to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-24", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-dives-into-complex-field-your-medical-records-1516832897"}, {"article": "(Repeats Feb. 25 story with no changes)  * Case pits interests of tech firms against law enforcement  * Microsoft balked at handing over data stored in Ireland  By Lawrence Hurley  WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - A major privacy rights fight between Microsoft Corp and the Justice Department reaches the Supreme Court this week, with the justices considering whether U.S. law allows prosecutors to compel technology companies to hand over data stored overseas.  The nine justices will hear arguments on Tuesday in a case that pits the interests of tech companies and privacy advocates in safeguarding customer data against the demands of law enforcement in obtaining information crucial to criminal and counterterrorism investigations.  The case began with a 2013 warrant obtained by prosecutors for emails of a suspect in a drug trafficking investigation that were stored in Microsoft computer servers in Dublin. The company challenged whether a domestic warrant covered data stored abroad. The Justice Department said because Microsoft is based in the United States, prosecutors were entitled to the data.  The case is being closely watched by other countries wrestling with similar concerns, including members of the European Union. A ruling is due by the end of June.  A 2016 decision by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals siding with Microsoft marked a victory for tech firms that increasingly offer cloud computing services in which data is stored remotely. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court.  Globally dominant American tech companies have expressed concern that customers will go elsewhere if they think the U.S. government\u2019s reach extends to data centers all around the world without changes being made to the law.  Microsoft, which has 100 data centers in 40 countries, was the first American company to challenge a domestic search warrant seeking data held outside the United States.  Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, told reporters last week the U.S. government should not be able to act unilaterally to access such data without taking into account the laws and interests of other countries.  \u201cIt\u2019s more likely to be a recipe for international tension and chaos,\u201d Smith said.  Solicitor General Noel Francisco, the administration\u2019s top lawyer in Supreme Court cases, said in court papers that a ruling for Microsoft \u201cwould hamper domestic law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts.\u201d  If the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of Microsoft, the government could still gain access data held overseas, but the process would be more cumbersome and potentially take longer.  Lawmakers are considering making changes to the 1986 law.  Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in Congress to update the statute, a move backed by both Microsoft and the administration. The measure would let U.S. judges issue warrants while giving companies an avenue to object if the request conflicts with foreign law. If Congress were to pass the bill before the Supreme Court rules, the case would likely become moot.  BEYOND REACH  Though Microsoft is based in the United States - Redmond, Washington, to be precise - the appeals court said the emails were beyond the reach of domestic search warrants obtained under a 1986 U.S. law called the Stored Communications Act.  The Microsoft customer whose emails were sought told the company he was based in Ireland when he signed up for his account.  Other companies including IBM Corp, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google filed court papers backing Microsoft. Google has mounted challenges similar to Microsoft\u2019s.  The administration has the support of 35 states led by Vermont who say they routinely seek access to data stored overseas, especially in cases involving child pornography.  Several foreign governments, including Ireland and Britain, filed court papers raising concerns about the U.S. government\u2019s position.  Ireland\u2019s government said in its brief that the question of how law enforcement authorities can access such information is already covered by a 2001 treaty with the United States that allows for information sharing and enforcement of court orders.  The treaty\u2019s procedures \u201crepresent the most appropriate means to address requests such as those which are the object of the warrant in question,\u201d Ireland\u2019s brief said.  The European Commission, representing the 28-country European Union, filed a brief saying that when a country is seeking data from outside its jurisdiction \u201cthe interests and laws of that foreign jurisdiction must be taken into account.\u201d  The Supreme Court has ruled twice in recent years in major cases concerning how criminal law applies to new technology, both times ruling against law enforcement.

Microsoft Corp. is releasing new cloud technologies to fight disease and help health-care companies abide by privacy laws as the software giant looks to win more business as the medical sector moves to internet-based computing.  Microsoft unveiled a tool for its Azure service that puts powerful computing resources to the task of gene-analysis for precision medicine \u2013 things like tailoring therapies to specific cancers. It\u2019s already in use at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, which will report its progress with extremely rare cancers at the American Association for Cancer Research conference in April, said Peter Lee, a Microsoft vice president for artificial intelligence and research.  The company is also releasing a blueprint for firms that want to move health data to the cloud while following privacy regulations. The company made the announcements ahead of a key health IT conference next week.  It\u2019s part of a renewed push into the health space by Microsoft, which has had several fits and starts in an area that has bedeviled many technology companies. A year ago, Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella tasked Lee to look at where Microsoft\u2019s cloud, AI and research work could make the company indispensable to health-care clients. Amazon.com Inc. has also announced plans to offer health services to its own employees, increasing the chance some medical companies will see the e-commerce and cloud leader as a rival, not a partner.  Microsoft Corporate Vice President Peter Lee Microsoft  Microsoft appeals to larger, highly regulated customers in the industry, while Amazon does better with health startups, said Kris G\u00f6sser, marketing vice president at Datica, which helps health companies move to the cloud with Azure and Amazon Web Services. Many of Microsoft\u2019s health-care products and ideas aren\u2019t new, but large, conservative firms are more likely to trust the company because it\u2019s a familiar partner, he said.  Microsoft is also offering templates for health companies that want to use its Teams corporate chat program, a rival to Slack, while ensuring conversations follow the industry\u2019s privacy and data-retention rules.  The company has also used its machine-learning tools to create Project Empower MD, a tool that automatically transcribes patient and doctor conversations, along with key moments from appointments, and formats the information in a standard way.  In several of these cases, Microsoft isn\u2019t creating finished products to sell but rather handing health companies tools that their own software engineers can use for in-house applications. Project Empower MD, for example, can be tweaked to how different doctors work, said Lee.  \u201cFor anyone who wants to innovate, anyone who wants to be able to extract the value of cloud computing and AI in health care, it\u2019s very important that the Microsoft platforms be a place for that,\" Lee said.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-28", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-28/microsoft-looks-to-lure-health-care-companies-to-its-cloud-with-new-tools"}, {"article": "It's easy to understand Apple CEO Tim Cook's somewhat self-righteous comments on the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal: His company has never emphasized customer data monetization, and privacy has been one of its persistent selling points. Apple still collects our data \u2014 and reserves the right to share it \u2014 but the company has a much better track record than newer tech titans.  \"The truth is, we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer \u2014 if our customer was our product,\" Cook said on Wednesday. \"We've elected not to do that.\" Asked what he'd do if he were in Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's shoes, he replied, \"I wouldn't be in this situation.\"  In reality, Apple collects more information about its customers than Facebook because it offers more products and services. It knows everything from an iPhone's location to its owner's taste in movies and music. It's all in the company's privacy statement, including the frank admission that Apple will share the data with \"strategic partners that work with Apple to provide products and services, or that help Apple market to customers\" and with law enforcement. Apple also lets applications that run on its platform (including Facebook) hoover up data. And it does have a small ad platform that allows targeted advertising.  Apple's closest equivalent in terms of data collection, sharing and \"pass-through\" to app developers is Google, which offers roughly the same array of services (plus search) and also owns mobile and desktop operating systems. The difference is that Apple has imposed some voluntary restrictions on itself: For example, it anonymizes location data (unless you're using the \"Find My iPhone\" feature) and generally employs \"differential privacy\" \u2014 a cryptography-based practice of obtaining usage and preference data without linking it to specific users. Google and Microsoft also use that to some degree, and a co-inventor of differential privacy, Cynthia Dwork, has even worked for Microsoft Research, but Apple was the first to market the technique as an advantage for its customers.  Cook clearly thinks of these self-restrictions as a good way of staving off external regulation. On Wednesday, he scolded Facebook for not being as far-sighted. \"I think the best regulation is no regulation, is self-regulation,\" he said. \"However, I think we're beyond that here.\"  As a user, however, I wouldn't put much trust in any company's ability to regulate itself. Cook has been wary of monetizing Apple's user base, but he won't be CEO forever. And people do change their mind, especially when it comes to picking up money that's there for the taking. Regulation \u2014 such as the EU's General Data Protection regulation, launching in May \u2014 is a more reliable way to ensure a level playing field. That's why Google, Apple and Microsoft all have good, convenient privacy controls which allow the user to turn off various kinds of data collection, erase data that companies already have and opt out of targeted advertising. Facebook, too, promises to put such controls in place soon.  But even external regulation isn't a reliable guarantee of privacy. Most people won't fiddle with the controls because they may not even realize what all the fuss is about. And by default, companies with advertising-based business models will want to collect as much information as they can and anonymize as little of it as they can. Neither Google nor Facebook, for example, will make the same commitment as Microsoft that no ads will be targeted based on your email and chat contents. Nor will they make it as easy as Apple and Microsoft make to shut off ad personalization.  No regulator will take care of that: It's not their goal to kill off the ad-based business model and with it Facebook and Google, and the model won't work without data collection and ad targeting.  The only real guarantee that companies won't go overboard in invading customers' privacy is that they have large revenue streams which make it an unnecessary risk. Apple is reliable in this regard: It's a hardware company that also sells content and software on commission and on a subscription basis. Microsoft, with its cloud, software licensing and subscription businesses, is even less likely to go rogue in data collection because it no longer has a mobile platform to speak of.  That's why Microsoft and Apple aren't suffering much from the Cambridge Analytica-triggered tech sell-off. Microsoft shares are up 4.5 percent since the beginning of the year, Apple shares are down just 1.63 percent. That compares to Google's 4.6 percent drop and Facebook's 13.3 percent dive. I believe the gains made by Twitter and Snap, two companies fully dependent on ads and information-gathering, are a temporary fluke: They aren't as frequently mentioned in connection with data harvesting as Google and Facebook. As heavier regulation of the ad model becomes reality, they will inevitably suffer as much as their ad-based peers.  Monetization through ads was the only relatively easy choice for companies not offering any products or services that people wanted to buy. That revenue stream, however, is not as easy to hold on to as those coming directly from customers. Those of us who remember the fat days of ad-financed media know that better than anyone. The tech firms that fell back on ads will need to offer value to customers, not advertisers, as the best \"legacy\" media companies have learned to do.

In its first major product event of the year, Apple will return to its roots in the education market. The event on Tuesday at Lane Technical College Prep High School in Chicago will mark the first time Apple has held a product launch geared toward education since 2012 when it unveiled a tool for designing e-books for the iPad. It\u2019s also a rare occasion for an Apple confab outside its home state of California.  A second grader works on an Apple Inc. iPad in Sandy, Utah. Photographer: George Frey/Bloomberg  In Chicago, the world\u2019s most-valuable technology company plans to show off a new version of its cheapest iPad that should appeal to the education market, said people familiar with the matter. The company will also showcase new software for the classroom, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private plans. Apple declined to comment.  Steve Jobs made schools a priority for Apple early in its life. But as the company has driven toward mass-market and higher-margin products in recent years, Google and Microsoft have had success breaking into classrooms with inexpensive laptops and tablets. Last year, the global educational technology market generated $17.7 billion in revenue, according to research firm Frost & Sullivan.  Apple accounted for 17 percent of mobile computing shipments to American students in kindergarten through high school, according to data from the third quarter published by Futuresource Consulting. Devices running Google\u2019s operating systems on Chromebooks or Android tablets held 60 percent of the market, and Windows PCs had 22 percent. While Macs and iPads make up less than 20 percent of Apple\u2019s sales combined, students and teachers are a key market to drive future purchases.  A new, cheaper MacBook laptop is in the works and likely destined to replace the MacBook Air at a price less than $1,000, but it probably won\u2019t be ready in time for next week, the people said. The MacBook Air, introduced about a decade ago, hasn\u2019t seen a major change since 2010, the same year the iPad came out. Although the laptop is popular with college students, it has languished as Apple focuses on more expensive Macs.  Rival laptops have made inroads into the education market lately, a field that originally helped Apple make its name. The sector is prized among industry giants because students learn to use a certain type of device, then head into the workforce and spread the technology wider.  With a recent advertising onslaught, Apple is hoping to capture more young minds with the iPad. The company has revised its tablet strategy over the years by releasing different versions at a variety of price points. That\u2019s helped the iPad business return to growth after multiple declining quarters. Still, demand for tablets is weak. According to research firm IDC, the market shrank by about 7 percent in 2017. Apple grew 3 percent last year and leads the industry with about a quarter of the market.  Apple's Tablet Roller Coaster iPad growth is returning after sales slowed for several quarters  Apple currently offers a slew of different education-related software. The company\u2019s Classroom app for the iPad lets teachers manage Apple devices that are assigned to students for their classwork. There\u2019s also an iTunes U app that lets teachers issue homework, grade assignments and post lessons online. It also lets students complete assignments and take tests. The company offers a software coding curriculum via the Swift Playgrounds app and sells interactive textbooks through its e-book store.  More software is coming. Apple is working on a new version of the iBooks app that\u2019s more in line with the design of the App Store, though it\u2019s unclear if it\u2019ll be shown next week, people familiar with the project have said.  In an invitation to the Chicago event, Apple said it will introduce \u201ccreative new ideas for teachers and students.\u201d Having a venue where attendees can see the new technology in action inside a classroom would be a sound strategy for a company that focuses its announcements on live demonstrations.  Next week\u2019s event will also provide an opportunity for Apple to boast about the work it\u2019s doing with Chicago schools. In December, the company partnered with the city\u2019s public school system and City Colleges of Chicago on a coding curriculum for thousands of local students. Apple has also discussed additional education-related programs with the city, people familiar with the talks said.  According to Apple\u2019s website, the school where the event will take place is not an \u201cApple Distinguished School,\u201d a designation given to institutions with curriculum that uses Apple products and provides iPads to all students.  Apple has tried citywide iPad deals for students in the past, with little success. In 2013, the Los Angeles Unified School District said it would spend $30 million to provide some students with iPads. The deal was expected to become a $1.3 billion initiative to give every student in the district an iPad, but it fell apart.  Such a deal won\u2019t be announced with Chicago next week, people familiar with the plans said. But the city could see more of Apple in the future.

A timing quirk in the tax overhaul seemed to give companies such as Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. -- all of which began their fiscal years before Jan. 1 -- the chance to reduce the foreign cash they\u2019ll accumulate this year and lower their taxes. A press release issued by the IRS on Monday indicates that \u201cif done in the ordinary course of business,\u201d the move won\u2019t be considered as tax avoidance, according to Stephen Shay, a tax and business law professor at Harvard Law School.  \u201cThe light is green for this planning, not red,\u201d said Shay, a former top Treasury official. \u201cIt is great for those whose years beginning before 2018 are still open for the planning.\u201d  While companies taking steps to shift their assets would still owe repatriation taxes, they wouldn\u2019t have as much cash taxed at the higher rate -- \"a major concession\" by the IRS, said independent tax and accounting expert Robert Willens.  The tax law signed by President Donald Trump in December overhauled the international tax system and requires companies to pay a mandatory two-tiered levy on their accumulated foreign income. Cash is taxed at 15.5 percent, while less liquid assets face a rate of 8 percent. Companies have been trying to figure out ways to reduce assets subject to the higher rate.  Another provision in the IRS release also allows multinationals some leeway when calculating their repatriation tax bills. The law appeared to make more foreign entities owned by multinationals subject to the repatriation tax, but the agency said Monday that taxpayers that own less than 5 percent of a foreign entity\u2019s capital or profits won\u2019t be hit by the repatriation tax.  \u2018Pro-Taxpayer\u2019 Notice  Banks and financial institutions will also see a reprieve following the IRS\u2019s guidance that a company\u2019s accounts receivable and accounts payable that are longer than one year will be exempt from the repatriation tax, said John Warner, a tax partner at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney PC. The financial firms had feared the payments under the loans they issue would have faced the 15.5 percent rate, since they\u2019re generally considered accounts receivable, regardless of their maturities.  \"This is generally pro-taxpayer,\" Warner said.  Still, the agency said it would crack down on some strategies multinationals may use to reduce their offshore tax bills, such as artificially reducing their earnings and profits, cash piles or \"pro-rata\" share of transactions, for foreign entities they have stakes in, own or control.  Those rules will be a big deal to some companies, said Michael Mundaca, the co-director of Ernst & Young\u2019s Washington National tax practice and a former top Treasury Department tax official.

Microsoft also announced a slate of new features for Teams, including instant language translation.  Slack's emergence as a popular platform for workplace messaging and document-sharing is a threat to Microsoft's long-standing dominance in office productivity software.  Teams now comes bundled with Microsoft Office 365 as the company battles rival offerings from companies including privately-held Slack, Alphabet Inc's Google , Atlassian Corp PLC , Cisco Systems Inc and Facebook Inc .  \"These group messaging tools go far beyond just chat and are becoming a central hub for integrating a variety of business applications into a single user interface,\" said Alan Lepofsky, analyst with Constellation Research. \"They are essentially the new inbox.\"  Microsoft has raced to make Teams a viable competitor after realizing several years ago that Slack was making inroads with big customers. A former Microsoft Office executive told Reuters that learning of the widespread adoption of Slack at Walt Disney Co in early 2015 was an especially important wake-up call.  \"It's one thing when an app gains traction with startups in Silicon Valley, that happens all the time,\" said the former employee, who asked not to be named. \"But it's another when your biggest, longest-tenured customers start adopting it, and then you realize you have to respond.\"  San Francisco-based Slack said in September that it had 6 million daily users and more than 50,000 paying teams. It has not published new figures since then.  Microsoft has not released comparable figures for Teams.  Slack has a big lead when it comes to third-party applications, with more than 1,000 compared to 250 for Teams.  Teams is still not as simple to use as Slack and lacks the depth of functionality, said Wayne Kurtzman, an analyst with the research firm IDC.  \"As great as Microsoft Teams has done in the past year, it's still not as mature of a product,\" Kurtzman said.  Microsoft says it is gaining ground, pointing to customers such as Navistar, the manufacturer of trucks and buses. Navistar moved about a thousand employees onto Teams last year, choosing it over Slack due to its long-time relationship with Microsoft, said Terry Kline, Navistar chief information officer.  \"We looked at Slack, and we didn't see any significant advantage,\" Kline told Reuters in a phone interview.  The move has reduced the company's use of email by 3 percent, he added.

But here, the pictures are created by the computer, pixel by pixel, from scratch,\u201d explained Xiaodong He, a principal researcher and research manager in the Deep Learning Technology Center at Microsoft\u2019s research lab in Redmond, Washington, in Microsoft\u2019s announcement. \u201cThese birds may not exist in the real world \u2014 they are just an aspect of our computer\u2019s imagination of birds.\u201d  The bot is able to generate a variety of images, researchers say, including everything from \u201cordinary pastoral scenes,\u201d like those with grazing livestock, to the absurd \u2013 like \u201ca floating double-decker bus.\u201d  Microsoft says the bot was trained on datasets of paired images and captions, allowing it to understand how to match up words to images. It learned to draw a bird, for example, when the caption says \u201cbird,\u201d and it learned what a picture of a bird should look like.  \u201cThat is a fundamental reason why we believe a machine can learn,\u201d said He.  The drawing bot\u2019s technology consists of two machine learning models \u2013 one to generate images from text descriptions, and another that uses text descriptions to judge the authenticity of the generated images. The former tries to get fake pictures past the latter, but the latter doesn\u2019t want to be fooled. Combined, the two work together to create higher-quality images.  In particular, it\u2019s good at drawing images from more complex sentences. While other technology could draw a bird from a caption that said \u201cbird,\u201d for instance, the quality would decline if you told it to draw a bird with a green crown, yellow wings and red belly. Before, this would have led to a blurry \u201cgreenish-yellowish-reddish bird,\u201d Microsoft explains.  What\u2019s especially interesting is how the bot can fill in the blanks when specific details aren\u2019t mentioned \u2013 basically, it has a little common sense and imagination of its own, thanks to its training data. In the bird example, the bot will usually draw a bird sitting on a tree branch even if that\u2019s not stated in the text, because the images originally fed to it often showed something similar.  According to a recent research paper, this new bot represents a nearly three-fold boost in image quality compared to prior technology, Microsoft also notes.  This isn\u2019t the first technology to combine AI with art, of course.  The intersection of the two sometimes leads to fantastic results, such as when Google\u2019s artificial intelligence drew those trippy machine-generated images that got their own art show. Google also has a neural net that guesses what you\u2019re drawing and an automated drawing bot, and regularly details the research it\u2019s doing in helping machines learn how to draw.  Facebook, too, has worked on teaching neural networks to make small images of things like airplanes, cars and animals, and even creating your own Bitmoji-like avatar from a photo.  Nvidia researchers created computer-generated celebrities, using A.I.  And there have been a slew of recent advancements in this space from others, as well.  For Microsoft, teaching a bot to draw an image from text completes the circle of other work its been doing in this computer vision and natural language processing space.  This includes the development of CaptionBot which automatically writes photo captions, and a technology that can answer questions people ask about images, like the location or attributes of objects \u2013 things that can be helpful for blind people.  As to what purpose an AI artist may serve in the real world, Microsoft has some ideas.  It suggests the bot could act as a sketch assistant for painters or interior designers, or could be implemented as a tool for voice-activated photo refinement. (\u201cCortana, draw a bird,\u201d perhaps?)  Further down the road, He says that, with more computing power, the technology could possibly generate animated films from screenplays to reduce the manual labor required today from animators.  But the technology isn\u2019t there yet.  If you look closely at the images, they\u2019ll almost always have flaws that indicate they were created by machines, not humans \u2013 like birds with blue beaks or fruit stands with odd-shaped bananas (see above).  However, with its touted 3-fold improvement, the bot represents an AI milestone of sorts, Microsoft says.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-18", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/01/18/microsofts-new-drawing-bot-is-an-a-i-artist/"}, {"article": "Microsoft\u2019s Slack competitor, Microsoft Teams, rolled out its biggest update since the software\u2019s launch last year, the company says. The focus of the new set of features is allowing users to better work with apps \u2013 something Microsoft Teams accomplishes via integrations, new search and discovery features, commands, and more.  Some of the features are, in fact, quite Slack-like.  For example, Microsoft Teams now offers a way to search for apps from the new app store where you can browse by category or search by name, category or integration type \u2013 like Project Management or BI. Slack, of course, also has its own app directory, which has allowed it to highlight all the work tools that currently work with its team collaboration resource \u2013 a move that helped it gain traction in the workplace.  In Microsoft\u2019s case, however, there\u2019s a bit more emphasis on the apps your organization has added and assigned to you, as well as those you regularly work with.  A new \u201cpersonal space\u201d displays all the items that you\u2019ve been assigned across your apps, like your tasks in Planner or issues in Jira Cloud, plus those from apps you\u2019ve recently accessed, like OneNote notebooks or videos from Microsoft Stream.  Microsoft even added its own new app called Who, powered by Microsoft Graph. This lets you search across your organization for people by name or topic.  The updated version of Teams also makes it easier to launch apps.  It\u2019s adding the ability to query or command an app from the command box to speed up the process of using the apps. That way, you can search for information from an app, then add a result right into your chat in a single workflow. This process will be improved in time, Microsoft says, and will eventually allow you to do more complex tasks, like creating a new task in your PM app or starting a build in Visual Studio Team Services.  Plus, adding information from an app to a chat has been improved \u2013 as you can now add an interactive card from apps into a chat or channel with just a click, instead of having to screenshot the data then post it.  Teams added slash commands with this update, too.  Similar to Slack, the slash command ( / ) lets you perform tasks or navigate Teams. But you can also use slash commands to do things like setting your status to \u201cAway,\u201d adding users to team, or calling a coworker, the company says.  This new set of features is rolling out starting today, says Microsoft, which means you may not see them immediately, but should soon.

A guide dog can\u2019t tell you that your favorite store is right around the corner if you\u2019re in an unfamiliar city or what street you are on, after all. With the app, users can set audio beacons for destinations and landmarks. Using GPS and the built-in compass in the phone, the app then generates its spatial audio cues. The mapping data is provided by OpenStreetMap.  \u201cObstacle avoidance is not the problem, we have a dog, a cane and our blindness skills for that,\u201d said Erin Lauridsen, Access Technology Director, LightHouse for the Blind in San Francisco in a blog post today. \u201cThe gap is knowing where things are and being able to decide what\u2019s of interest.\u201d  The app offers three modes: \u2018locate\u2019 tells you where you are, \u2018around me\u2019 calls out four points of interest around you and \u2018ahead of me\u2019 provides the names of five landmarks in front of you.

Acquiring EA would be a much more bold move, but it would significantly boost Microsoft\u2019s software division and both companies appear to share the belief that games as a service is the way forward for the industry.  Certainly, the Xbox Game Pass service would truly become the true Netflix of games if it was able to boast titles from third-parties.

This would go some way to explaining all those floor plans showing a comparatively small Microsoft booth that were doing the rounds earlier in the year.

On Tuesday the Supreme Court will consider if U.S. internet providers can subvert federal law and public safety.  At issue in Microsoft v. U.S. is whether warrants issued under the 1986 Stored Communications Act apply to records stored on the cloud. The law allows the government to obtain records from a U.S. internet provider if there is probable cause of a crime. A special Section 2703 warrant functions like a subpoena since law enforcement doesn\u2019t directly seize records from servers.  In 2013 the U.S. government sought such a warrant for contents associated with an MSN.com email account believed to include evidence of narcotics trafficking. A federal magistrate issued a warrant covering \u201cinformation associated with\u201d the account \u201cstored at premises owned, maintained, controlled, or operated by Microsoft Corporation.\u201d  While Microsoft agreed to disclose records stored on its U.S. servers, it refused to turn over content on its \u201ccloud\u201d servers in Dublin, Ireland. The Redmond, Wash.-based company, which was held in civil contempt, says the law doesn\u2019t authorize extraterritorial warrants. It\u2019s right on this point, but wrong on everything else.  In Morrison (2010) and RJR Nabisco, Inc. (2016), the Supreme Court developed a two-step analysis to determine if a law applies overseas. First, courts must ask whether a law includes a \u201cclear, affirmative indication that [the statutory provision] applies extraterritorially.\u201d If not, the statute is presumed not to be extraterritorial.  But then courts must assess whether a case primarily \u201cinvolves a domestic application of the statute\u201d by looking at its \u201cfocus.\u201d As the Court held in Nabisco, \u201cIf the conduct relevant to the statute\u2019s focus occurred in the United States, then the case involves a permissible domestic application even if other conduct occurred abroad.\u201d  This second part is key in the Microsoft case. There\u2019s no disputing that the Stored Communications Act doesn\u2019t expressly apply to foreign parties. The government could not compel an internet provider based in France to hand over a French citizen\u2019s emails. But as the judge who issued the warrant observed, the government\u2019s application of the law \u201cdoes not criminalize conduct taking place in a foreign country\u201d and doesn\u2019t deploy U.S. cops overseas.  Employees at Microsoft headquarters could obtain records stored on foreign servers with a few keystrokes. Internet providers typically decide where to store data to maximize efficiency. Google cuts up emails into \u201cshards,\u201d which can move between countries within seconds without human intervention. U.S. internet users aren\u2019t entitled to know where in the cloud their records are stored, let alone to recourse under U.S. law if a company moves them.  A federal district judge held that the Microsoft warrant wasn\u2019t extraterritorial since the disclosure of records to the government occurs in the U.S. But a Second Circuit Court of Appeals panel disagreed in 2016, and tech companies have since resisted warrants for data stored overseas. While the circuit refused to hear the case en banc, Judges Jos\u00e9 Cabranes, Dennis Jacobs, Reena Raggi and Christopher Droney wrote an incisive dissent on the far-reaching implications of the panel\u2019s rogue ruling, which conflicts with every other district and magistrate decision.  The panel \u201chas substantially burdened the government\u2019s legitimate law enforcement efforts; created a roadmap for the facilitation of criminal activity; and impeded programs to protect the national security of the United States and its allies,\u201d the judges explained.  Tech firms argue that a Court decision upholding the government\u2019s authority to compel disclosure of data overseas would cause international friction due to conflicting legal regimes on data privacy. But more than a dozen countries including Australia, France, Ireland, Canada and the U.K. assert this authority. The U.S. would be an outlier.  They also argue that Congress is better situated to resolve the complicated issues of cloud computing that were never envisioned three decades ago. Senators Orrin Hatch and Chris Coons have introduced legislation to modernize the Stored Communications Act and clarify legal obligations for internet providers.  But pending legislation shouldn\u2019t obviate a judicial decision on a black-and-white legal question critical to public safety. Letting a flawed ruling stand would lead to more needless failures in law enforcement.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-27", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsofts-legal-cloud-cover-1519689734"}, {"article": "Here are some of the companies with shares expected to trade actively in Tuesday\u2019s session.

The case, set to be heard next month, stems from a dispute between the Justice Department and Microsoft Corp. over access to emails stored on a server in Ireland. Industry officials say it highlights the stark differences between the U.S. and Europe over views on online privacy and the extent of government access to users\u2019 data.  The U.S. government in 2013 obtained a search warrant requiring Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft to hand over email information as part of an investigation into a customer who allegedly was using the account to conduct criminal drug activity.  Microsoft complied with part of the order but rebuffed the request to turn over the email messages, which were stored abroad, arguing that U.S. search warrants don\u2019t reach data stored outside domestic borders. Microsoft argues that complying with the warrant would have meant the company could have run afoul of EU privacy rules.  At issue in the court case are broader questions about who should govern global internet companies, and how. In particular, cloud computing companies, such as Microsoft or Amazon.com Inc., can move data among different servers around the world.  Microsoft says it stores users\u2019 data in the region where a user resides and customers should be in control of their data.  The U.S. argues that its warrant required Microsoft to hand over the information because it can be accessed in the U.S. with the click of a computer mouse, and lack of access to that data could pose significant barriers to ongoing investigations.  \u201cHundreds if not thousands of investigations of crimes\u2014ranging from terrorism, to child pornography, to fraud\u2014are being or will be hampered by the government\u2019s inability to obtain electronic evidence,\u201d the Justice Department said in a court brief.  A U.S. government win in the case could hand U.S. companies operating in Europe an expensive dilemma: either comply with U.S. data requests or risk breaching EU data privacy rules. European companies with business operations in the U.S. also fear they could receive similar requests from American authorities sent to their headquarters abroad.  \u201cThis untenable position would throw a wrench into the countless routine business arrangements that comprise today\u2019s highly interdependent commercial world,\u201d the largest trade organizations from Germany, Ireland, Poland and France said in a joint filing to the court.  Foreign governments can access evidence in Europe for criminal investigations, but the preferred method under EU law is to go directly through member states, as part of what is known as a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty. That approach will be enshrined in the bloc\u2019s new data protection regulation, to enter into force in May. The new rules threaten fines as high as 4% of a firm\u2019s global revenue for failure to comply.  Washington\u2019s position seems to fly in the face of EU sovereignty, some European officials and legal experts said.  \u201cThis can clearly escalate to being a conflict of law and international relations,\u201d said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a Green Party member of the European Parliament and staunch privacy advocate. \u201cThe question [is] if the EU can expect that their own laws apply to their own territory and market or is the U.S. trying to put that into question?\u201d  Companies, governments and institutions in Europe and elsewhere have submitted third-party briefs to the court ahead of the hearing, which is set for February 27. A decision is expected by June.  The U.K., one of the U.S.\u2019s closest law-enforcement allies in Europe, has thrown its weight behind Washington\u2019s arguments in the case. Britain, which is preparing to exit the EU, is also currently negotiating a bilateral treaty with the U.S. over access for law-enforcement purposes to electronic communications held on servers in each other\u2019s jurisdictions.  The case is reminding some Europeans of leaks by one-time National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosing that U.S. tech companies cooperated with the NSA, allowing authorities to access information through a so-called backdoor. Those revelations sowed deep mistrust in Europe of U.S. intelligence practices, straining trans-Atlantic ties and hindering cooperation between Washington and Brussels in other areas.  U.S. tech companies also came under scrutiny from the broader public following the revelations. That is one reason Microsoft is fighting so hard: to maintain its reputation. Microsoft says it has only provided data to the U.S. government under valid legal orders.  \u201cPre-Snowden, this would have been done quietly, there would have been an accommodation\u201d between Microsoft and the government, said James A. Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cEveryone would have gone away happy.\u201d  Now, \u201cthey need to show the world, their global customer base, that they\u2019re not just going to roll over every time the U.S. government asks them for something,\u201d he said.

The tax is due regardless of whether they bring it home or not, though companies may choose to pay it over eight years. Businesses must generally book this tax as a one-time charge in the final quarter of 2017. Apple said this month it would pay $38 billion in taxes and return the majority of its overseas cash to the U.S.  The taxes companies pay on these profits will vary somewhat, depending on both the size of the profits and how they have been invested. Companies must pay 15.5% on liquid assets, such as cash and a variety of marketable securities, and 8% on other assets. Technology companies tend to have a larger amount of liquid assets as a share of their overseas stockpile than other industries: For instance, 95% of networking giant Cisco Systems Inc.\u2019s accumulated foreign profit last year was in cash and cash equivalents, versus 22% for retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  The Wall Street Journal estimated that 311 large publicly traded companies could generate nearly $250 billion in these taxes, of which 38% could be paid by tech companies.  Tax rates  Tech giants generally enjoy low effective tax rates because a portion of their profits accumulate in low-tax foreign jurisdictions. Tech firms paid an average tax rate of 24% over the 10-year period through 2016, below the 29% average tax rate for all companies in the S&P 500 for that period and lower than any other industry, according to an analysis of corporate filings by Zion Research Group.

That means firms like Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Cisco Systems, which over the past decade have paid lower tax rates on average than the new statutory rate of 21%, may soon see their rates go up. International Business Machines Inc., which paid a tax rate of 12% last year excluding one-time benefits, said this month its rate will rise to as much as 18% in 2018.  The five biggest tech companies\u2014 Apple Inc., Alphabet, Microsoft Corp. , Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. \u2014all report earnings this week and investors will be looking for guidance on tax rates.  Use of capital  Now that companies are free to bring foreign cash to the U.S. at no added cost, they will be dogged with the question of how they plan to spend it. Tech firms are already among the biggest spenders on research and development and on acquisitions. Adding to these budgets may not be the answer.

The Republicans sold the tax overhaul on the promise that it would return investment to the U.S., not to enrich shareholders.  \u201cIt will be interesting to see what companies ultimately do with more unfettered access to their global cash,\u201d said Kirsten Malm, a partner at law firm Baker McKenzie who advises tech firms on taxes. \u201cIs this going to set off a new wave of M&A? Will we see share buybacks?

Yet Google almost pulled it off in just under seven years.  On March 5, nine-year-old restaurant guide Infatuation announced it was buying the Zagat brand for an undisclosed amount. The company\u2014best known for its #eeeeeats hashtag\u2014now controls the 35-year-old Zagat name and its international catalog of reviews.  For some, the question isn\u2019t why Google sold off Zagat; it\u2019s what took so long. The relationship between the two companies had been troubled for years. The 2011 purchase was championed by former Google executive Marissa Mayer, who saw Zagat as an asset for the maps division she controlled. But by 2013, some reviewers panned the release of the Zagat app, which had a difficult user interface and seemed designed to push content such as \u201cRose for Every Mood: What to Bring to Any Summer Occasion,\u201d rather than help people find a good place to eat.    Then, a few years ago, Google chose to infuse its mapping services with features such as user-generated restaurant reviews, rather than leveraging Zagat and its resources. It was a defensive move to ward off rivals such as Yelp Inc. and Apple Inc., which were then credible threats to Google\u2019s dominance in local information. Zagat, meanwhile, was left to wither.  The end of an era.  How did this happen? When Mayer departed in 2012, Zagat was left without a champion at Google, according to a former Zagat contractor who requested anonymity. Instead of hiring additional full-time staff, Google relied on contractors for content and assigned a minimal number of engineers for such major projects as the app launch and a 2017 web redesign, according to several people who worked for Zagat at the time. Gradually, the number of contractors working on Zagat content decreased\u2014there were just over a dozen to cover the globe\u2014and coverage of notable cities such as London and Toronto was suspended.  Google declined a request for comment.  Eventually, the staff was told to de-emphasize reviews, which were the backbone of the business. Instead, employees were directed to focus on boilerplate guide lists, such as \u201cBest Brunch\u201d and \u201cBest After Work Drinks.\u201d The changes left the remaining staff frustrated, according to the former contractor.  Tim and Nina Zagat founded their eponymous guide as a hobby in 1979. The couple, having met at Yale Law School, started the business after a guest criticized a newspaper\u2019s restaurant reviews at a dinner party. The Zagats began soliciting friends\u2019 opinions and found 200 amateur critics to rate 100 restaurants for food, d\u00e9cor, service, and costs. An empire was born. For years, the Zagat guide was part of the calculus of figuring out where you were going to eat.    Those days are long gone. By 2017, Zagat failed even to send out its annual survey\u2014the basis for its restaurant rankings. No guide was produced, and no explanation was given.  Flashback. Photographer: Paul Taggart  Zagat freelancers weren\u2019t notified of the Infatuation deal beforehand, according to a current contractor who requested anonymity. Instead, they were told on Friday night that security was being updated and that they would be locked out of Zagat tools, the contractor says. By Monday morning, they were given the press release.    Infatuation didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. In a statement, the site said it will operate Zagat as a separate brand, with a new, tech-driven platform that will be an alternative to other crowdsourced restaurant reviews.  In October, Google held its second Local Guides Summit in San Francisco. The program encourages users of the company\u2019s Maps app to upload photos and write reviews of places such as restaurants and to submit new locations. During the summit, Google announced that 50 million people were contributing to the program, a 1,000 percent increase from the 5 million it tracked in early 2016. More than 700,000 venues are being added to Maps each month, according to the company. Maps has more than 1 billion users, making it a lot more efficient and broader than Zagat\u2019s restaurant-review system.  \u201cI assume Google figured out that they didn\u2019t need the brand name in order to surface the information,\u201d said restaurateur Nick Kokonas, whose Alinea dining room topped the list in the 2012 Chicago Zagat guide. \u201cAt the end of the day, Google can get all that Zagat information without actually owning Zagat, right?\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Bergen", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-07", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-07/here-s-how-google-almost-destroyed-zagat"}, {"article": "Google said it plans to acquire Xively, a unit of LogMeIn Inc., in a bid to capture sales from businesses that manage a growing number of devices connected to the internet.

Publishers will keep 85 percent to 95 percent of revenue when readers first buy subscriptions via Google, up from 70 percent previously, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  Publishers\u2019 feelings toward Silicon Valley are starting to shift as some technology companies are showing they want to compete for content. Last week, Apple Inc. offered an olive branch to the media industry by buying Texture, a digital service that lets users subscribe to more than 200 magazines for $9.99 a month. Apple and Google are trying to seize on a moment when Facebook\u2019s ties with news outlets have soured.  The relationship between news providers and \u201cthe major digital platforms -- how they think about content, how they think about publishers, how they think about data -- feels more in flux right now than it has in a long time,\u201d Mark Thompson, chief executive officer of the New York Times Co., said in an interview.  The new financial terms are part of \u201cSubscribe with Google,\u201d a feature that gives media companies data and tools to find and keep subscribers. It was one of several announcements the search giant made in New York on Tuesday to appease publishers whose content helps Google sell advertising.  \"Our mission is inherently tied to your mission,\" Philipp Schindler, Google\u2019s chief business officer, told a room of media executives.  Subscriber Tool  When consumers sign up for a subscription using \u201cSubscribe with Google\u201d at a publisher\u2019s website, Google will keep just 5 percent of the revenue, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information. If they use the tool at the Google Play Store, that goes up to 15 percent.  On Tuesday, Google said it would share data to help identify potential paying readers and that users\u2019 search results would more prominently feature publications they subscribe to. The company also said it would dole out $300 million to support digital journalism globally over the next three years.  \u201cWe welcome the fact that Google has listened to and responded to some of our asks about our subscription business,\u201d Thompson said. He also said he\u2019d like to see Google and others share advertising revenue with publishers, since the tech companies make big profits by selling online ads around other providers\u2019 news content.  \u201cAny kind of comprehensive solution to do with sustaining quality journalism on these major platforms will have to consider the advertising side of the equation as well,\u201d Thompson said.  Boost Relations  Apple\u2019s purchase of Texture last week was that company\u2019s latest effort to boost relations with news outlets. Apple once touted the iPad as a potential savior for the industry, which has struggled for years with declining subscribers and print advertising. In 2011, News Corp. created an iPad-only newspaper called The Daily, but shut it down in less than two years after failing to find a big enough audience.  Conde Nast President Bob Sauerberg said he\u2019s optimistic Apple\u2019s acquisition will start a new chapter that will benefit his stable of glossy magazines, which include Wired and The New Yorker. Conde Nast was a co-owner of Texture.  \u201cThey have big ambitions,\u201d Sauerberg said.  Sauerberg said not all tech giants have put publishers at the top of their priority lists, but for now, \u201cI feel really good we\u2019re at the top of the list for Apple and for Google.\u201d  IPhone App  Apple\u2019s focus with publishers has been on distributing their stories on Apple News, an app that comes installed on millions of iPhones. Media executives say Apple News could be a significant source of online readership. But so far they\u2019ve seen little money from it.  Apple News is a way to attract more Times readers, especially outside the U.S., \u201cbut without significant economics attached,\u201d Thompson said. The Times distributes articles on Apple News, but is not participating in the subscription program.  Facebook, meanwhile, has sent mixed signals to publishers. In October, the world\u2019s largest social network began a test to support paywalls in Instant Articles and letting publishers keep all the revenue from subscriptions. In February, it launched a three-month pilot program to help local newspapers attract more subscribers.  But the company has also said its algorithm will start prioritizing News Feed posts from friends and families, hurting publishers\u2019 web traffic.  \u201cGoogle has been the most responsive of the major platforms in terms of listening, trying to understand what we need, and changing their business rules,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen that kind of responsiveness from Facebook at all, actually.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Gurman", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-20", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/google-said-to-sweeten-deals-with-publishers-as-tech-woos-media"}, {"article": "James Damore, right, speaks at a news conference with his attorney, Harmeet Dhillon, on Jan. 8, in San Francisco.  Google\u2019s firing of an engineer over his controversial memo criticizing its diversity policies and \u201cpolitically correct monoculture\u201d didn\u2019t violate U.S. labor law, a federal agency lawyer concluded.  Statements in James Damore\u2019s 3,000-word memo \u201cregarding biological differences between the sexes were so harmful, discriminatory, and disruptive\u201d that they fell outside protections for collective action in the workplace, an associate general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board wrote in a six-page memo disclosed Thursday.  Damore withdrew his complaint in January and his lawyer has said she\u2019s focusing instead on the engineer\u2019s lawsuit accusing the internet giant of harassing him and others over their conservative political views.  When he was dismissed in August, Damore accused Google of violating the employee right to engage in \"concerted activity\" to address workplace issues, a category which the labor board has found can include forms of activism ranging from lawsuits to strikes to social media posts.  \u201cMuch of\" Damore\u2019s memo was probably protected under the law, the labor board\u2019s attorney, Jayme Sophir, said in the Jan. 16 memo. But Sophir went on to find that Google discharged Damore only for his \"discriminatory statements,\" which aren\u2019t shielded by labor law.  Because companies have a duty to comply with equal employment laws and an interest in promoting diversity, \u201cemployers must be permitted to \u2018nip in the bud\u2019 the kinds of employee conduct that could lead to a \u2018hostile workplace,\u2019 rather than waiting until an actionable hostile workplace has been created before taking action,\" Sophir wrote.  The company \u201ccarefully tailored\" its messages in firing Damore and in addressing employees afterward \"to affirm their right to engage in protected speech while prohibiting discrimination or harassment.\" Google also disciplined one of Damore\u2019s co-workers for sending him a threatening email in response to the memo, Sophir said.  Fired Google Engineer Faces Headwinds Seeking Legal Recourse  Google declined to comment on Sophir\u2019s memo. Damore\u2019s attorney didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.  The labor board lawyer\u2019s conclusion is \"consistent with board precedent for decades, which has viewed speech which creates a hostile environment likely to produce both discord and divisiveness as unprotected,\" said William Gould IV, who chaired the board under President Bill Clinton.  \"In the course of protesting working conditions you can be profane and aggressive and unpleasant, you can be militant, and it\u2019s still protected,\" Gould said.

Two anonymous people, who describe themselves in court filings as businessmen, want the search engine to take down links to information about their old convictions.  One of the men had been found guilty of conspiracy to account falsely, and the other of conspiracy to intercept communications, Judge Matthew Nicklin said at a pre-trial hearing Thursday. Those convictions are old and are now covered by an English law -- designed to rehabilitate offenders -- that says they can effectively be ignored. With a few exceptions, they don\u2019t have to be disclosed to potential employers.  \u201cThis is the first time that the English court is going to decide the issue of the right to be forgotten,\u201d Nicklin said.  The search-engine giant has already become embroiled in battles at the European Union\u2019s top court over the right to be forgotten. The principle -- created by the EU\u2019s highest court in a precedent-setting ruling in May 2014 -- allows people to ask for links to online information about them to be removed from search results if it\u2019s outdated or irrelevant. The ruling is only valid in the 28-nation bloc, but Google has clashed with privacy regulators over attempts to apply it beyond the EU.  \u201cWe work hard to comply with the right to be forgotten, but we take great care not to remove search results that are clearly in the public interest and will defend the public\u2019s right to access lawful information,\u201d a Google spokeswoman said.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs didn\u2019t comment.  Not Celebrities  Nicklin said Thursday that while the two cases were not related, they raised the same legal issues. The first trial, in which the person challenging Google to remove information is known as NT1, will start on Feb. 27 and the second, in which the plaintiff is known as NT2, will start on March 13. Nicklin said the plaintiffs weren\u2019t celebrities or politicians and have been \u201crehabilitated\u201d since their convictions.  NT1 has been threatened in public places by people referring to the content that Google links to, \u201cand seeking to extract money from him in consequence,\u201d his court filings say. He \u201chas been and continues to be treated as a pariah in his personal, business and social life and has been unable to form any new friendships or personal relationships,\u201d they say.  \u2018Adverse Attention\u2019  NT2\u2019s papers say some financial institutions are unwilling to deal with him \u201con private or commercial business\u201d after looking him up on Google. The search engine results have attracted \u201cadverse attention\u201d to him and by association to members of his close family.  The case concerns an \u201carea of the law in which two human rights come into conflict,\u201d Nicklin said. \u201cThe right to be forgotten is a dimension of the right to privacy and it conflicts with the right of freedom of expression.\u201d  He said a U.K. law from 1974 meant that, for all but the most serious offenses, people with convictions shouldn\u2019t \u201chave a lifelong \u2018blot\u2019 on their record but should be able to live without that shadow.\u201d The internet \u201cprovides a challenge\u201d to that right, he said, but also noted that some people were concerned that the right to be forgotten \u201cmight lead, in effect, to censorship.\u201d  Google has \u201cstaked quite a lot of resources\u201d on trying to do a good job of deciding when to approve requests for links to be taken down, said George Brock, a journalism professor at City, University of London and the author of a 2016 book about the right to be forgotten. He said Google had been \u201copaque\u201d about its approach to making those decisions. If this case shed light on how it reached the decisions, \u201cit would be a real breakthrough,\u201d he said.  Super-Injunctions  The men are being represented by the law firm Carter Ruck. It has defended clients in privacy and libel actions and was one of the first firms to use super-injunctions, court orders that prevent publication of any confidential information relating to a person or an issue and also any existence of the order itself.  The pair\u2019s court papers say that revealing their identity would \u201cdefeat the object of the claims.\u201d  Google has publicly raised the alarm about risks to freedom of speech that it says are posed by the right to be forgotten. Two separate European Court of Justice cases about that right \u201crepresent a serious assault on the public\u2019s right to access lawful information,\u201d Google\u2019s general counsel, Kent Walker, said in a blog post in November.

The number given is a \"perfect number.\"  Google has a history of making mathematical references.  In its Q4 earnings report on Thursday, Google's parent company Alphabet announced plans to buy back some of its stock \u2014 $8,589,869,056 of stock to be exact.  There's a likely reason Google chose that specific value for their planned buyback: It's what mathematicians call a \"perfect number.\"  Perfect numbers are whole numbers with a fun property \u2014 they are the sum of all their proper divisors, or the whole numbers that evenly divide into the original number, except itself. The smallest perfect number is 6: 6 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, and itself. But then take those first three divisors and add them up, and you get 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.  8,589,869,056 is such a number. It has a few too many divisors to write out here \u2014 33 proper divisors in total \u2014 but the sum of its proper divisors does in fact come back up to itself.  In addition to their defining curious property, perfect numbers are relatively rare. They are closely connected to a certain class of prime numbers called Mersenne primes, or prime numbers that are one less than 2 raised to some prime number. Each even perfect number has a corresponding Mersenne prime.  Mersenne primes are interesting because it's relatively computationally easy to check whether a candidate Mersenne prime is in fact prime. Because of that, most of the largest prime numbers yet discovered are Mersenne primes, including the largest currently known prime number, 2 77,232,917 - 1.  Only 50 Mersenne primes have been found so far, which means because of their correspondence, only 50 perfect numbers are known so far. That makes Google's buyback choice quite a special number.  Google has a history of making mathematical references. In 2011, the company bid a multiple of pi in an auction for Nortel Networks' tech patents. Shortly after renaming itself Alphabet in 2015, the company announced a buyback in the amount of $5,099,019,513.59, which happens to be the square root of 26 x 10 18\u2014 26, of course, being the number of letters in the alphabet.

Google announced a bunch of new, key partnerships with companies including LG, Sony, and Lenovo to integrate with the Google Assistant.  However, Amazon's Alexa, and its line of Echo smart speakers, still dominate the market, with no signs of slowing down.

Plus, companies like Bose and LG are building Assistant into their headphones and TVs, respectively.  This was all clearly Google's way of striking back at Amazon Alexa, the market leader in this new category of voice-command devices.  Amazon was far and away the winner of last year's CES, with Alexa the star of many show-floor demonstrations. Google was at last year's CES, too, promoting its Google Home speakers. But all anybody wanted to talk about was Alexa.  At the 2018 show, Google Assistant grabbed the spotlight.  \"It is too early to measure the impact of Google's presence at CES, but they certainly made an impression,\" says Gartner Research Director Werner Goertz, who was at the show.  People lined up for hours at CES 2018 to try out this Google Assistant-powered vending machine, which dispensed prizes just for trying out the technology. Matt Weinberger/Business Insider  Indeed, Google has made great strides in catching up with Alexa in a very short time. The first Amazon Echo, which introduced Alexa, dropped in 2014. Google Home was released in late 2016, and within a year, had established itself as the most meaningful opponent to Alexa. I, personally, prefer Google Assistant to Amazon Alexa in my everyday life.  Google's \"smart displays\" are a direct answer to the Amazon Echo Show and Echo Spot, the first-ever Alexa devices with screens. And all of those new partner product integrations make the Google Assistant way more competitive with Alexa, which used its head start to establish itself as a dominant standard in the smart home.  This is all fine, as far as it goes. But the problem for Google as it rushes to play catch-up: Amazon hasn't stood still.  Amazon Echo is also getting better  First and foremost are the numbers; Amazon hints that Alexa products are outselling Google's. While Google says that it sold about 7 million Google Home speakers over the holiday season, Amazon said that it sold \"tens of millions\" of Alexa products over the same period. Without exact figures, it's hard to get a direct comparison, but the message is clear, and Google is lagging.  A big reason for that success is that Amazon keeps iterating and releasing new products. Just last year, Amazon released an all-new Echo, the Echo Plus home hub, the fashion camera Echo Look, the Echo Show, the Echo Spot, and even Echo Buttons, simple Bluetooth game controllers for the Echo.  Google, for comparison, released two new Home speakers, the $50 Mini and the $400 Max. And while Google claims the former is selling quite well, the latter is definitely more of a niche product for higher-end audiophiles (or wannabe DJs).  Those new Home products are good in their own right, but they're not as interesting as Amazon's Echo experiments. For instance, Amazon is playing around with new ways to interact with Alexa \u2014 the Echo Look camera helps you create a fashion look book for yourself; the Echo Plus streamlines the complicated process of adding smart home gear. Meanwhile, the Google Home Mini and Max are just variations on the same basic concept for a smart speaker that Amazon pioneered with the original Echo back in 2014.  Lots of companies were proudly promoting their Google Assistant integrations at CES 2018. Matt Weinberger/Business Insider  On the software side, both companies are getting better and at a fast rate. This is actually where Google shines, as its investments in artificial intelligence means that Google Home is getting better by the day at playing music, mapping a route, or even letting you know when a flight is cheap.  Gartner's Goertz lauds the progress Google has made with building out the Google Assistant ecosystem, but says there's still a ways to go, partnership-wise, to really catch up with Alexa.  Meanwhile, Amazon is making serious investments in turning Alexa into a platform. This year, as we previously reported, Amazon has big plans to start paying developers of the 30,000 Alexa \"skills,\" or apps, which could turn Alexa into an economy and ecosystem all on its own.  Google hasn't quite gotten to that point with Assistant yet, and so developers could well feel like there's a bigger incentive to stick with Alexa.  In short, Google is making serious inroads and has become the biggest roadblock to Amazon just completely running away with this young market. But Amazon is proving once again that it can move faster than its rivals. Google will have to pick up the pace if it wants to go beyond dominating CES, and into dominating the market.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-21", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/google-assistant-versus-amazon-alexa-2018-1"}, {"article": "Google Hangouts Chat on the PC web browser. Google  Google is finally releasing Hangouts Chat, its messaging app for business.  It's going right up against Microsoft Teams, Cisco Spark, and the $5 billion Silicon Valley startup Slack.  This is yet another attempt by Google to create a successful messaging platform. However, competition in this space is steep.  On Wednesday, Google is expected to make Hangouts Chat, its long-promised workplace chatroom tool for businesses, available to enterprise users of its G Suite productivity service. Google shared the news in a blog entry.  Hangouts Chat is available from the web browser, or from iOS and Android apps.  The service was first announced almost exactly a year ago, right alongside Hangouts Meet, a videoconferencing tool. Hangouts Meet has been available to the public for months, but Chat has so far only been available to a relative few G Suite customers in the Early Adopter Program.  Now, Hangouts Chat will go right up against some of tech's biggest guns. $5 billion startup Slack provides what many consider the gold standard in team communication software, while the similar Microsoft Teams is a key part of the Office 365 cloud productivity suite for businesses.  That makes Hangouts Chat both a challenge and an opportunity for Google: If users like it, G Suite could lure away even more Microsoft Office customers. However, all of that competition means Google has its work cut out for it.  Google Hangouts Chat on the smartphone. Google  Like Slack, Hangouts Chat is built for intra-company communication. Each chatroom can support up to 8,000 members. Google bills integrations with the rest of the G Suite services \u2014 including Google Docs, Google Drive, and Google Sheets \u2014 as key selling points for Hangouts Chat.  Like Slack and Microsoft Teams, Hangouts Chat supports chatbots. It comes with a total of 25 bots built in, including bots to tell you when a Google Drive file is updated, or when you have a Google Calendar appointment. You can also install bots that integrate with outside services, like Atlassian Jira or Salesforce CRM.  While Google is renewing its push for businesses, the company may have its work cut out for it: Its messaging strategy is famously convoluted, with would-be successors to Hangouts like Google Duo and Google Allo largely failing thus far to find an audience.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-28", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/google-hangouts-is-now-available-2018-2"}, {"article": "Google is launching a major update to Google Sheets today that\u2019ll make the life of spreadsheet jockeys just a little bit easier \u2014 and may just make the switch from Microsoft Excel a bit more tempting for some.

Even setting aside the sweating philosophical toil of algorithmically sifting for some kind of universal truth, were Mountain View to truly live up to its own mission statement it would entail massive philanthropic investments in global Internet infrastructure coupled with Herculean language localization efforts.  After all \u2014 according to a Google search snippet \u2014 there are close to 7,000 languages globally\u2026  Which means every piece of Google-organized information should also really be translated ~7,000 times \u2014 to enable the sought for universal access. Or at least until its Pixel Buds actually live up to the universal Babel Fish claims.  We\u2019ll let Alphabet off also needing to invest in vast global educational programs to deliver universal worldwide literacy rates, being as they do also serve up video snippets and have engineered voice-based interfaces to disperse data orally, thereby expanding accessibility by not requiring users can read to use their products. (This makes snippets of increasing importance to Google\u2019s search biz, of course, if it\u2019s to successfully transition into the air, as voice interfaces that read you ten possible answers would get very tedious, very fast.)  Really, a more accurate Google mission statement would include the qualifier \u201csome of\u201d after the word \u201corganize\u201d. But hey, let\u2019s not knock Googlers for dreaming impossibly big.  And while the company might not yet be anywhere close to meaningfully achieving its moonshot mission, it has just announced some tweaks to those aforementioned search snippets \u2014 to try to avoid creating problematic information hierarchies.  As its search results unfortunately have been.  Thing is, when a search engine makes like an oracle of truth \u2014 by using algorithms to select and privilege a single answer per user generated question \u2014 then, well, bad things can happen.  Like your oracle informing the world that women are evil. Or claiming president Obama is planning a coup. Or making all sorts of other wild and spurious claims.  Here\u2019s a great thread to get you up to speed on some of the stupid stuff Google snippets have been suggestively passing off as \u2018universal truth\u2019 since they launched in January 2014\u2026  Google became the world\u2019s go-to source of information by ranking billions of links from millions of sources. Now it often presents a seemingly definitive answer above other search results \u2014 and many are contentious, improbable or laughably incorrect. https://t.co/ezepEiJAOT \u2014 Jack Nicas (@jacknicas) November 16, 2017  \u201cLast year, we took deserved criticism for featured snippets that said things like \u2018women are evil\u2019 or that former U.S. President Barack Obama was planning a coup,\u201d Google confesses now, saying it\u2019s \u201cworking hard\u201d to \u201csmooth out bumps\u201d with snippets as they \u201ccontinue to grow and evolve\u201d.  Bumps! We guess what they mean to say is algorithmically exacerbated bias and very visible instances of major and alarming product failure.  \u201cWe failed in these cases because we didn\u2019t weigh the authoritativeness of results strongly enough for such rare and fringe queries,\u201d Google adds.  For \u201crare and fringe queries\u201d you should also read: \u2018People deliberately trying to game the algorithm\u2019. Because that\u2019s what humans do (and frequently why algorithms fail and/or suck or both).  Sadly Google does not specify what proportion of search queries are rare and fringe, nor offer a more detailed breakdown of how it defines those concepts. Instead it claims:  The vast majority of featured snippets work well, as we can tell from usage stats and from what our search quality raters report to us, people paid to evaluate the quality of our results. A third-party test last year by Stone Temple found a 97.4 percent accuracy rate for featured snippets and related formats like Knowledge Graph information.  But even ~2.6% of featured snippets and related formats being inaccurate translates into a staggering amount of potential servings of fake news given the size of Google\u2019s search business. (A Google snippet tells me the company \u201cnow processes over 40,000 search queries every second on average\u2026 which translates to over 3.5 billion searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year worldwide\u201d.)  Google also flags the launch last April of updated search quality rater guidelines for IDing \u201clow-quality webpages\u201d \u2014 claiming this has helped it combat the problem of snippets serving wrong, stupid and/or biased answers.  \u201cThis work has helped our systems better identify when results are prone to low-quality content. If detected, we may opt not to show a featured snippet,\u201d it writes.  Though clearly, as Nicas\u2019 Twitter thread illustrates, Google still had plenty of work to do on the stupid snippet front as of last fall.  In his thread Nicas also noted that a striking facet of the problem for Google is the tendency for the answers it packages as \u2018truth snippets\u2019 to actually reflect how a question is framed \u2014 thereby \u201cconfirming user biases\u201d. Aka the filter bubble problem.  Google is now admitting as much, as it blogs about the reintroduced snippets, discussing how the answers it serves can end up contradicting each other depending on the query being asked.  \u201cThis happens because sometimes our systems favor content that\u2019s strongly aligned with what was asked,\u201d it writes. \u201cA page arguing that reptiles are good pets seems the best match for people who search about them being good. Similarly, a page arguing that reptiles are bad pets seems the best match for people who search about them being bad. We\u2019re exploring solutions to this challenge, including showing multiple responses.\u201d  So instead of a single universal truth, Google is flirting with multiple choice relativism as a possible engineering solution to make its suggestive oracle a better fit for messy (human) reality (and bias).  \u201cThere are often legitimate diverse perspectives offered by publishers, and we want to provide users visibility and access into those perspectives from multiple sources,\u201d writes Google, self-quoting its own engineer employee, Matthew Gray.  No shit Sherlock, as the kids used to say.  Gray leads the featured snippets team, and is thus presumably the techie tasked with finding a viable engineering workaround for humanity\u2019s myriad shades of grey. We feel for him, we really do.  Another snippets tweak Google says it\u2019s toying with \u2014 in this instance mostly to make itself look less dumb when its answers misfire in relation to the specific question being asked \u2014 is to make it clearer when it\u2019s showing only a near match for a query, not an exact match.  \u201cOur testing and experiments will guide what we ultimately do here,\u201d it writes cautiously. \u201cWe might not expand use of the format, if our testing finds people often inherently understand a near-match is being presented without the need for an explicit label.\u201d", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-31", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/01/31/google-tweaks-search-snippets-to-try-to-stop-serving-wrong-stupid-and-biased-answers/"}, {"article": "Google is rolling out a few new features to its Google Flights search engine to help travelers tackle some of the more frustrating aspects of air travel \u2013 delays and the complexities of the cheaper, Basic Economy fares. With the regard to delays, Google Flights won\u2019t just be pulling in information from the airlines directly, however \u2013 it will take advantage of its understanding of historical data and its machine learning algorithms to predict delays that haven\u2019t yet been flagged by airlines themselves.  Explains Google, the combination of data and A.I. technologies means it can predict some delays in advance of any sort of official confirmation. Google says that it won\u2019t actually flag these in the app until it\u2019s at least 80 percent confident in the prediction, though. (Of course, you should still get to the airport on time, but at least you\u2019ll know what you\u2019re about to face once there.)  It will also provide reasons for the delays, like weather or an aircraft arriving late.  You can track the status of your flight by searching for your flight number or the airline and flight route, notes Google. The delay information will then appear in the search results.  The other new feature added today aims to help travelers make sense of what Basic Economy fares include and exclude with their ticket price.  These low-cost fares are often the only option for travelers on a budget, but they have a number of restrictions that can vary by airline.  Google Flights will now display the restrictions associated with these fares \u2013 like restrictions on using overhead space or the ability to select a seat, as well as the fare\u2019s additional baggage fees. It\u2019s initially doing so for American, Delta and United flights worldwide.  These changes come only a month after Google Flights added price tracking and deals to Google Flights as well as hotel search features for web searchers.  The additions seem especially targeted toward today\u2019s travel startups and businesses, like Hopper which had just added hotel search, and uses big data to analyze airline prices and other factors; or TripIt, a competitor of sorts to Google\u2019s own travel app Google Trips, which most recently introduced security checkpoint wait times.

However, what\u2019s clear after four days of using this, is that it\u2019s an early adopter\u2019s product. In the Indian context, it\u2019s not a product that will serve any real purpose in your life, at least not yet.  I have always maintained that AI platforms become slightly dumber in India. Yet, if we were to compare the level of intelligence these platforms are capable of, the Google Assistant would almost always come out shining, just ahead of Amazon\u2019s Alexa and followed by Microsoft\u2019s Cortana.  Yeah, let's not even talk about Siri here.  In India, smart assistants are still learning. If these were real people, the Indian versions of these assistants would be the equivalent of school children, while global/US versions feel more intelligent, like college kids. It's a long way to adulthood either way.  And on that note, let's talk about the Google Home. A smart home product, that, like the Amazon Echo, has been talked about in some detail. So much so that you may even be expecting the one speaker to rule them all here.  Alas! Amazon couldn't do it and neither can Google. I'll skip over the bits about design here since my global colleagues have written about it already.  Using the Google Home in India  Like the Echo before it, the Home is very much an early adopter\u2019s product in India. The primary difference is that unlike other such products, it's not big riddled and gives you the full experience of what you can expect.  That said, there's work to be done as far as app support etc. are concerned. The Home plays music from Play Music only right now. So, when you ask for a song, it will search through Google's catalogues and find the best match. Often, that isn't close to being right. A tad too often to be honest.  I asked the Home to play \u2018New York, New York\u2019 by Frank Sinatra. It played \u2018One For My Baby\u2019 by the same artist. Google\u2019s My Activity page shows what the Home heard: \u201cPlay up the road by Frank Sinatra\u201d. So, it found the closest match.  The My Activity page also tells me that I asked it to \u201cplay tennis\u201d once. I surely didn't. However, it was up to the task when I asked it to \u201cplay some Michael Buble\u201d or \u201cplay Havana\u201d. The margin for error here is the same as the Echo, and having used the Echo for just over six odd months now, I'm pretty accustomed to it.  In hindsight, the Echo started off similarly, before getting used to my accent and pronunciation. And it still misses at times. I'm hoping Google's AI copes better and learns faster.  What I don't like though is how often the Home just doesn't register a command. I've had to modulate my voice quite often with the Home. That's especially frustrating when you wake up in the middle of the night and ask for something.  The Home just sat there often, while I screamed - \u201cHey Google\u201d, \u201cOk, Google\u201d, \u201cOii! Google\u201d and more. To be clear, only the first two commands would and should have woken the speaker up. The Home seems to go into a slumber at times and refuses to wake up.  When it does listen, I can ask for reminders to be set, jokes to be told, time, travel info and more. Pretty much anything that the Google Assistant can do, the Home can do, too.  Smart Home  I had a lone Philips Hue Ambiance bulb to test the Home with. The Hue\u2019s smart home Bridge needs to be set up before the Google Home can control it. The Home and Hue Bridge have to be on the same WiFi network for this to work.  You can toggle the intensity of the Hue Ambiance or turn it on/off using the Home. Once set up, you can control it from anywhere using the Google Assistant, as long as you're connected. I had the Home and Echo dot placed side-by-side on the same network, and the lag time between command and activity are the same on both.  Setting up the Hue is obscenely easy. The Home app by Google has a \"Home Control\" section. You head over here, tap on the \"+\" icon and add devices. Done. The Home asks for your Philips Hue account and automatically connects the Hue Bridge you set up earlier.  The Hue Ambiance is rather limited in what it can do, but the Home can control the full suite of things other Hue bulbs can do.  Controlling smart homes though is a niche utility in India, to say the least. The Hue Ambiance, which is the cheapest in Philips' portfolio, is priced at just over Rs 2,000 here. Other Hue bulbs often touch upwards of Rs 10,000. If you're already invested in IoT products, the Home might be a good idea.  What remains to be seen is whether the ecosystem develops around this. Google boasts extensive support for smart home products, though most of the brands aren't doing business in India just yet. Like Amazon, the company will have to push for these brands to start selling here.  App support  Amazon boasts over 10,000 skills for Alexa in India, so Google needs to catch up. That said, the Assistant already has a bunch of usable skills in the country.  Yet, the Home lacks app support. It has support for Gaana and Saavn at the moment and Google says it wants to add more. However, apps like Uber and all others need to be added.  The brightside is that support for Google Cast covers a lot of your media requirements. Apps like Pocket Casts, Wynk and some others can stream to the Home directly via Google Cast.  Audio Quality  The Home and Echo aren't meant to be audio products. Yet, if you do buy a speaker, the audio experience is worth noting. What I can confirm here is that the Home sounds decidedly better than the Echo. Michael Buble's baritone voice sounds better and more detailed on the Home when compared to the Echo. The music experience, in general, is richer too.  As a standalone speaker, the Home is more versatile than the Echo. It's loud enough to fill a room or two - though that would really depend on the size of your rooms. I have 10x10 rooms in my house, which are well served.  That said, don\u2019t go expecting UE Boom/Wonderboom-level audio quality.  Summing up  It's been just four days with the Home, so I can't quite pass a weighty verdict yet. But, as I said before, the Google Home is an early adopter's product. If you're buying this, you're either gifting it to a geek or a geek yourself.  It doesn't have real usage that will change your life. It's not a product you NEED, it's a product you really, really want. For those who do buy it, the novelty will wear off in a few weeks, after which we'll have to wait till India catches up with the global standards in smart homes.  If Google is to sell this to the general public, it will have to have offline stores to show the Home. It\u2019s an experiential product. One that you want only after you\u2019ve...umm...spoken to it.  Price and offers  The Google Home is priced at Rs 9,999 in India, while the Home Mini will sell for Rs 4,499. Both products are available on Flipkart and retail stores like Croma, Reliance Digital, Vijay Sales and more.  Google is also bundling a JioFi router and \u201cstreaming music subscriptions\u201d with the Home. If you buy the product at Reliance Digital stores, you will get a JioFi router with 100GB 4G data, while Croma outlets will bundle the Philips Hue with the Home and Home Mini.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-10", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-home-india"}, {"article": "Google today launched Google Home and Home Mini smart speakers from its \u2018Made by Google\u2019 portfolio in India.  The Google Assistant-powered speakers were first showcased in October, where Google also announced a bigger Google Home Max AI-based speaker. However, the Home Max has not made it to India alongside its smaller siblings.  Both the smart speakers function on voice commands and can perform tasks like cast audio and video, play music, get answers from Google, set reminders, tell you about your day, control smart home devices and lot more.  To make Google Assistant more relevant for Indian users, Google has added Indian customisations to the speaker. The company recently introduced Hindi language support with 10 other regional languages. Also, the Assistant now is better at recognising the Indian accent. To expand the content on Google Home, the company has partnered with multiple homegrown companies.  Google Home and Home Mini price and availability  Google Home and Google Home Mini will be priced at Rs 9,999, and Rs 4,499 respectively and will be available for purchase online exclusively on Flipkart, and in over 750 retail stores across the country including Reliance Digital, Croma, Bajaj Electronics, Vijay Sales, Sangeetha, and Poorvika.  Google Home Mini is available in two colours \u2013 Chalk and Charcoal \u2013 while Google Home will be available in Chalk. Coral will be coming soon.

But like most flagship phones, they don\u2019t come cheap: starting at $649 (\u00a3629, AU$1,079) for the smaller Pixel 2 and $849 (\u00a3799, AU$1,399) out-of-pocket for the Pixel 2 XL.  As such, it\u2019s wise to find some protection for your investment. Most enthusiasts don\u2019t want to cover up the lush design of their phone, and we totally understand why, but the last thing you want is to send it away for repair.  Below, you\u2019ll find several case recommendations that cover a wide range of budgets and style preferences. While we\u2019ve personally used most of the following cases, some of these options are untested. Nevertheless, we\u2019re confident that each entry is a cut above the rest due to their value and design.  Image 1 of 4 A paper-thin case Image 2 of 4 Fits the Pixel 2 like a glove Image 3 of 4 Peel's case leaves buttons and curved glass exposed Image 4 of 4 You can barely tell it's there  Super Thin Case from Peel  If you\u2019re reluctant to cover up the slim design of the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, you won\u2019t find a case that\u2019s more trim and thin than Peel\u2019s. It snaps right onto the phone and hugs its curves without adding extra bulk.  Due to this case\u2019s ultra-skinny profile, it\u2019s not a case that you want to put through much turmoil. It prevents micro-scratches, but it likely won\u2019t prevent damage from a drop, and in the case of the Pixel 2 XL, its curved glass isn\u2019t protected in the slightest.  All said, Peel\u2019s cases make an excellent impression on design geeks, and so long as you\u2019re cool with its flimsiness, you won\u2019t find a case that better accentuates the Pixel 2\u2019s look.  Check out the case right here: (Pixel 2) (Pixel 2 XL)  Incipio Multi Stripes case  It's surprisingly hard to find a Pixel 2 case that adds some wild flair, but Incipio's fits the bill, but for more than just being vibrant.  At its affordable asking price, it cradles Google's phone real close \u2013 even providing a lip over the screen to prevent scratches or cracks from accidentally sliding it on the table face-first.  Let's be honest, the best thing about this case is that it just looks nice. Most of us here consider the Pixel 2 to be a good-looking phone, but if you've got to protect it, you might as well add some style.  Image 1 of 4 This case doesn't add much bulk Image 2 of 4 It matches the look of the Pixel 2 nicely Image 3 of 4 The buttons preserve their 'click' through the case Image 4 of 4 The case raises above the glass to protect the screen  Fabric Phone Case from Google  Google\u2019s own case for Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL does well at maintaining the slim look and feel of the phones. Unlike the other options on this list, this one adds microfiber material to the list, giving it a classy look that enhances the grippiness in hand.  We like this case for several reasons. Its price is tolerable, it\u2019s available in a few different colors (Carbon is pictured, but Cement, Midnight and Coral are for sale) and it makes all of the Pixel 2\u2019s features easily accessible. The buttons are effortless to push, making it feel like there\u2019s no case on at all. It also raises the phone\u2019s front so that the glass display isn\u2019t grazing any surfaces.  The only downside in our experience is that fuzz from your pocket gets into the grooves near the screen. Simply wiping it away cleans things up, but it\u2019s annoying to have to do that each and every time you pull it out. Also, the bottom of the phone near the charging port isn\u2019t protected on the front, which subjects it to scratching.  This one's currently available on Amazon in a few different color varieties, but if you can't find it, head to the links below.  Image 1 of 4 See the cases's two layers? Image 2 of 4 Image 3 of 4 Makes the buttons nice and clicky Image 4 of 4 Protects the phone from all corners while maintaining a low profile  Live Case from Google  It should be no surprise that Google\u2019s cases don\u2019t fuss with their phones\u2019 design too much. The Live Case is a more durable option over the Fabric Case, giving it two levels of protection. To pop it on, there\u2019s a silicon case that\u2019s protected by a tough shell that has the design of your choice on it.  Every angle of the Pixel 2 is protected here, including the camera and screen. The buttons feel nice to press and better yet, the Live Case functionality is interesting. Your phone's wallpaper can match the look of the case by downloading the Live Case app and putting in the code that's printed on its inside.  Removing and reapplying the Live Case takes a bit of practice, though we never felt like it was close to breaking. All in all, this case is best if making something custom is a high-priority for you.  You should be able to find a nice variety of pre-designed Live Cases on discount through Amazon, but should you want to customize, head to the links below.  Image 1 of 4 This case has quite the bumper Image 2 of 4 You'll encounter a bit of bulk here Image 3 of 4 The buttons feel a bit stiff under the protective layer Image 4 of 4 This case adds bezels to an otherwise bezel-lite phone  Evo Check Case from Tech21  While not the most rugged case in its design, the Evo Check case by Tech21 is taking us into options that add a fair amount of bulk to the Pixel 2.  This case fits the Pixel 2 snugly, adding on the company\u2019s FlexShock barrier to make it drop-friendly from distances up to 10 feet. Overall, it strikes a nice balance between form and function, showing off the Pixel 2\u2019s design highlights while making sure to protect it from all sides.  Google\u2019s cases on this list provide better button feedback. Here, the phone\u2019s buttons felt a little too difficult to push in, though it\u2019s possible that they might loosen up over time. But we\u2019re a fan of this case\u2019s added grip factor and the mesh design.  They're also available from the Tech21 site: Pixel 2 | Pixel 2 XL  Image 1 of 4 This case looks low profile without the Pixel 2 inside Image 2 of 4 But the phone looks fossilized in amber once popped in Image 3 of 4 The buttons are a little too tough to press, but still functional Image 4 of 4 A smaller, slightly less protective barrier than Tech21's case  Presidio Clear Case from Speck  This clear case from Speck is durable, yet simplistic in design \u2013 an impressive feat given how robust of a protector it is. If you\u2019re after a rugged case that has hints of a slimline look and feel, this is one to look out for.  Once the Pixel 2 is slid into the Presidio Clear, it\u2019s protected from dropping from up to eight feet. Sure, it\u2019s less than the 10 feet guaranteed by Tech21\u2019s option, but Speck\u2019s case shows off the design of the phone a bit better.  Some complain that this case makes holding the phone a more slippery affair, however, we haven't noticed this yet in our testing. This sort of thing certainly depends on how oily the case becomes, either through body oils or from touching it after eating.  Incipio Reprieve Sport 2.0 case  The low-profile build of a slimline case combined with a textured rim and bumper-packed corners describes the look and feel of the Incipio Reprieve Sport 2.0.  It's not the cheapest case around, but unlike slimmer options, this one will offer protection from every angle without masking the Pixel 2's look.  We always appreciate when a rugged case yields responsive buttons and easy access to ports, and to that end, this one is worth checking out in your favorite color.  Bellroy Leather case  Google has partnered up with Bellroy as one of its premium 'Made for Google' providers, and the fruits are stunning.  The Bellroy Leather case comes in a variety of color options for both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, and doesn't really cost as much you might think.  The leather on its back is supple and smooth, transitioning into matte plastic running around the trim of your device. Bellroy's case doesn't provide button extenders, but pushing them in doesn't require any additional effort.  This case gives off a really high-end look and those looking to suit the Pixel 2 up as nice as you dress yourself, you'll be pleased with Bellroy's latest.  Kerf wood case  There's something that your Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL is missing. It's wood, yep wood. Kerf makes its own phone cases by hand, complete with a flattering design, and backs it with a lifetime warranty.  Not just any regular wooden case would impress us, but this one \u2013 even at the low-end $69 walnut option \u2013 is a top option if you want to protect your Pixel 2.  The buttons are responsive, the suede inside cradles the form factor perfectly and heck, it just smells good. When have you ever bought a case that you enjoy smelling?", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-01", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/google-pixel-2-cases"}, {"article": "Apple is trying to catch up. Not only is it beefing up its phones with \"neural engine\" chips to power AI efforts like augmented reality and machine learning, it's also building out its Siri team. The company recently listed 161 open positions and hired Carnegie Mellon's Russ Salakhutdinov last year to head up AI research. Earlier this week, Apple confirmed perhaps its most important hire yet in the space: former Google AI chief, John Giannandrea.  According to Apple, Giannandrea will head up Apple's \"machine learning and AI strategy\" and report directly to CEO Tim Cook. Seeing as Giannandrea was responsible for making AI central to Google's overall strategy, his new role as Apple's AI lead seems to indicate Siri might be getting a serious makeover. And maybe, just maybe, Siri might just learn a few of the following Google Assistant tricks in the process.  Better search  When it comes to search, it'll be difficult for Apple's Siri to really go head-to-head against Google Assistant, simply because Google is the king of search. But there are other ways that Siri could become smarter here. Even though Siri has contextual search -- the ability to answer follow-up questions -- it's wildly inconsistent.  For example, when I asked Siri \"Who is the president of the United States?\" and then followed it up with \"Who is his wife?\" it sometimes misunderstood or misheard me, giving me definitions of the word \"wife\" instead. (It did respond with \"Melania Trump\" once, but only once). When I asked the same question to Google Assistant, it was completely flawless, even offering me a list of Trump's former wives. When I asked more follow-up questions like her age or her height, Google was much more accurate here as well.  Sometimes Siri doesn't give direct answers at all. When I ask Siri \"what sound does a dog make?\" it brings up a list of search results. But when I ask Google the same question, it literally plays an audio file of a dog barking. Sure, I don't expect Siri to answer complicated questions, but it should at least know the answers to basic kindergarten-level queries without bringing up basic search results. Since Giannandrea has experience in both voice-recognition and search, he might be able to influence improvements in this area.  Siri could also stand to improve the overall search experience. Right now, if you ask a question, you'll either get a single page or a list of results. Google presents a list of related answers in a menu underneath, just in case you want to know more about a topic.  Another area that Siri can learn from Google Assistant is simply a better understanding of who you are and have that inform search results. For example, if I tell Google that my favorite team is the San Francisco Giants, it'll simply return the scores of last night's game if I say \"how are the Giants doing?\" or just \"how did my favorite team do last night?\" Siri, on the other hand, would ask me \"Do you mean the New York Giants or the San Francisco Giants?\" every single time. That's just tiresome.  Smart-home integration  Perhaps one of the smartest moves Google has made in recent years is to make its assistant central to its overall hardware strategy. It's not only in phones; it's also in a variety of smart speakers and most of the Nest lineup. This kind of wide cross-platform and cross-disciplinary approach is what Giannandrea was known for, and he could very well implement the same philosophy to Apple as well.  One area that certainly needs a lot of help is how Siri works in the latest Apple HomePod. Sure, it has great audio quality, and it works well with some HomeKit compatible products like the Phillps Hue lights, but its functionality just doesn't compare with Amazon's Echo or Google's Home.  Siri on the HomePod can't even handle multiple timers or, shockingly enough, initiate phone calls. It also doesn't play well with a few key third-party apps -- it can't order an Uber or a Lyft, and it doesn't work with any other streaming music service except for Apple Music. Yes, Siri does work with some apps like WhatsApp, WeChat and Evernote but the list of third-party apps is pretty small compared to its rivals.  Also, Google's Home can recognize people by their voice, Siri on HomePod can't. That means that any ol' stranger can come up to your speaker and access your iMessages unless you set up a restriction beforehand. Seeing as Siri on the iPhone is able to discern voices pretty well, it's surprising that this function was not carried over to the HomePod.  Third-party support  Last but not least is third-party support. Apple traditionally has a walled garden philosophy when it comes to a lot of its products, as you can tell from the HomePod and Apple Music example above. But it might have to eventually let it go. One of the most frustrating things with Siri on the iPhone is that it seems pretty stunted if you use anything that's not Apple. If you ask it to play a certain song on Spotify, it'll just launch the app without playing anything. If you ask it for directions on Google Maps, the app will open, but you're on your own from there.  Though Google does favor its own apps for some things -- it'll automatically play podcasts from Google Play, for example -- it's at least better with third-party integration than Apple.  Still, it doesn't mean Siri is worse than Google Assistant at everything. As we discovered in our week with Google Assistant, Siri seemed better at pronouncing names and was a little better in the back-and-forth sass department. It was also really good at recognizing voices on mobile -- not just anybody can activate your phone with \"Hey Siri,\" only you can (We should note that Google Assistant can do this too). Plus, since Siri is already baked into your iPhone, it's by far the easiest voice assistant to use if you have an iOS device.  While it's still early days yet in Giannandrea's Apple tenure, if he even takes a few of the lessons he learned from Google and brings them to Apple, it will be an improvement. Let's hope that happens.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-07", "source": "engadget", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/07/what-siri-can-learn-from-google-assistant/"}, {"article": "Google announced a new feature today that will help you out when you're deciding what movie to go see.

So far, none of the new units have become significant businesses. Alphabet executives have stressed many of the bets will need years to pay off and only a few need to succeed for the Alphabet strategy to work.

Get past the absurdity of his framing his grievance in terms of identity politics\u2014he\u2019s a victim of Google\u2019s failure to honor \u201cviewpoint diversity.\u201d Apparently under California law this is a legitimate claim.  Last year\u2019s firing episode at first seemed a case of Google clumsily suppressing dissent over race and gender policies adopted after the company\u2019s workforce was found to be overwhelmingly white and male. Now it seems like something else.  If the postings and emails cited in Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit are a reliable indication, founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have lost control of the culture. Google\u2019s leaders may even be a little afraid of their employees.  Mr. Damore\u2019s firing last year by CEO Sundar Pichai certainly rang of panic at the time. Google explicitly invites freewheeling discussion and provides internal forums for it. Mr. Damore did not, in his famous memo, object to Google\u2019s diversity goals. His ruminations on biology may be jejune, but unwelcome facts are still facts. Witness the work of David Lubinski at Vanderbilt, which goes a long way toward explaining the recruiting frustrations of many a tech and engineering-based company. Prof. Lubinski and colleagues find that women who are gifted in math and science tend to be broadly gifted, and consequently have lots of opportunities in a wide range of fields, whereas men with math talents tend to be narrowly gifted, and all end up in math-science-engineering fields.  Not that Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit, in which he is joined by another recently fired male engineer, turns on the validity of his Darwinian musings. In the postings and emails he quotes, colleagues spew hate at Mr. Damore, apparently without consequence.  We see them giving each other employee-awarded \u201cpeer bonuses,\u201d supported by Google\u2019s \u201cRecognition Team,\u201d for denouncing him. We see Google employees explicitly reject talking to, listening to or working with colleagues whose politics they don\u2019t share.  We see them proposing blacklists. One paints as incapable of coming up with anything \u201ccreative or innovative\u201d any meeting consisting of \u201c40-something white men,\u201d and Google HR approves the sentiment. An employee asks if \u201cmen\u201d were changed to \u201cwomen,\u201d would the post still be approved? No response.  Another posting calls on Googlers to decline to participate in industry panels alongside \u201ccheesy white males.\u201d  One Googler who says he refuses to \u201ctolerate\u201d broad categories of people (e.g., Trump voters) might seem regrettable, especially after it turns out he\u2019s German and lives in Switzerland. When it becomes a competition, a cultural disease is at work. Incipient here is a world that people in Google\u2019s home state are already familiar with. It\u2019s the world of California\u2019s maximum-security prison system, where inmates survive only by kneeling to one identity-based gang or another.  If there is a lesson here for other companies\u2014and don\u2019t take this the wrong way\u2014it\u2019s the value, broadly, of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u201d  To work together on software, people don\u2019t need a company-supplied forum to discuss their politics, their sexual interests, their cultural antipathies. Offering it seems pointlessly divisive.  Perhaps the most symbolically disturbed posting is one demanding that control of Google be wrested from the \u201chorde of racist and sexist people we\u2019ve already hired.\u201d  To be white and male is not to be sexist and racist. The statement \u201cI don\u2019t want to be denied an opportunity because of my gender and race\u201d is as valid for a white male as it is for a black, gay, female or furry. (Yes, Google\u2019s internal discussion board includes consideration of the \u201cfurry\u201d lifestyle, which involves dressing up in animal costumes.)  Some predict Google will quickly settle to avoid discovery of more emails and postings, including from top management. What seems worse, from a public-relations perspective, is a culture inveterately hostile to the liberal principle \u201cI may disagree with what you say but defend your right to say it.\u201d This can\u2019t be good in a business whose mission is to organize the world\u2019s information.  Messrs. Brin, Page and Pichai likely feel a tad helpless. The U.S. legal system imposes a need to be race-aware, gender-aware, etc.\u2014to require quotas in all but name, since quotas are illegal. Google simultaneously faces lawsuits and regulatory investigations directed at its alleged shortchanging of women on pay and promotions.

They do\u2014more than ever. The problem is that the money generated by news audiences flows mostly to Google and Facebook , not to the reporters and publishers who produce excellent journalism.  The Duopoly now captures 83% of all digital ad revenue growth and 73% of U.S. digital advertising, according to a CNBC report. As a result, newspapers\u2019 online audience growth does not produce revenue to match. According to data from Pew, newspaper advertising revenue fell from $22 billion in 2014 to $18 billion in 2016 even as web traffic for the top 50 U.S. newspapers increased 42%.  Local news is most at risk. As print circulation declines, community news publishers have the hardest time adapting to the ever-changing demands of Facebook and Google algorithms. We think of \u201cfake news\u201d as a national phenomenon, but in the absence of a workable news business model, wild rumors and conspiracy theories could become more influential at the local level, too.  Tech savvy, digital-only publishers are also struggling. BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti said in December that Google and Facebook are \u201cpaying content creators far too little for the value they deliver to users,\u201d and that \u201cthis puts high-quality creators at a financial disadvantage, and favors publishers of cheap media.\u201d  A user launches the Facebook app on his phone. Photo: Elise Amendola/Associated Press  Google and Facebook have become the primary and de facto regulators of the news business, and governments around the world are starting to recognize the danger. British Prime Minister Theresa May announced earlier this month that her government would review the economics of internet news consumption. Regulators in Germany, Israel and South Korea are investigating how Google\u2019s business practices have disrupted the media market and harmed publishers and consumers. U.S. regulators, on the other hand, have rarely looked into Google or Facebook\u2014and never at their influence in the news marketplace.  Some voices on the left and right are calling for Google and Facebook to be regulated as utilities. But there is an easier solution: exempt news publishers from certain aspects of antitrust regulation.  U.S. antitrust laws, designed to promote fair competition and prevent consolidation, actually make it harder for traditional news outlets to compete with Silicon Valley giants. Under current law, for instance, news publishers cannot get together and agree to withhold their product unless they receive a return on their investment. Let\u2019s start by changing that simple inequity. News publishers should be able to use their collective leverage in negotiations with big tech.  Rep. David Cicilline, top Democrat on the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee, is expected to introduce a bill to do that next week. The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act of 2018 is a low-regulation, pro-market way to unleash the news industry\u2019s negotiating power. If antitrust enforcers can\u2019t protect society from the outsize influence of modern-day trusts, the least the government can do is get out of the way and let publishers protect themselves and their readers.

The monopolies of old and of today were built on proprietary technology and physical networks that drove down costs while locking in customers, erecting formidable barriers to entry. Just as Standard Oil and AT&T were once critical to the nation\u2019s economic infrastructure, today\u2019s tech giants are gatekeepers to the internet economy. If they\u2019re imposing a cost, it may not be what customers pay but the products they never see.  In its youth Standard Oil was as revered for its technological and commercial brilliance as any big tech company today. John D. Rockefeller began with a single refinery in Cleveland in 1863 and over the next few decades acquired other, weaker refineries. Those that wouldn\u2019t sell, he underpriced and drove out of business. By 1904, companies controlled by Standard Oil produced 87% of refined oil output, according to Mike Scherer, a retired Harvard economist who has written extensively on antitrust.  This wasn\u2019t superficially bad for consumers. The price of kerosene, the principal refined product from oil, fell steadily as Standard Oil\u2019s market share expanded, thanks to falling crude oil prices and Standard Oil\u2019s economies of scale, bargaining power with suppliers such as railroads, and innovation, such as the Frasch-Burton process for deriving kerosene from high-sulfur oil in Ohio.  Standard Oil's refinery in Richmond, Calif., in 1911. Photo: Library of Congress/Corbis/VCG/Getty Images  When the federal government sued to break up Standard Oil, the Supreme Court acknowledged business acumen was important to the company\u2019s early success, but concluded that was eventually supplanted by a single-minded determination to drive others out of the market.  In a 2005 paper, Mr. Scherer found that Standard Oil was indeed a prolific generator of patents in its early years, but that slowed once it achieved dominance. Around 1909 Standard\u2019s Indiana unit invented \u201cthermal cracking\u201d to improve gasoline refining to meet nascent demand from automobiles, but the company\u2019s head office thought the technology too dangerous and refused to commercialize it. After the Indiana unit was spun off when the company was broken up in 1911, it commercialized the technology to enormous success, Mr. Scherer wrote.  Big Spenders Top tech companies owe their market position in part to heavy investment in new products and technology. R&D spending as a share of revenue Intel 21.5% Facebook 21.2% Alphabet  15.5%  Microsoft  13.8%  Johnson & Johnson  12.5%  Amazon*  11.8%  Apple  5.1%  General Motors  4.9%  General Electric  4.0%  Procter & Gamble  2.9%  AT&T  1.0%  Exxon Mobil  0.5%  The story of AT&T is similar. It owed its early growth and dominant market position to Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s 1876 patent for the telephone. After the related patents expired in the 1890s, new exchanges sprung up in countless cities to compete.  Competition was a powerful prod to innovation: Independent companies, by installing twisted copper lines and automatic switching, forced AT&T to do the same. But AT&T, like today\u2019s tech giants, had \u201cnetwork effects\u201d on its side.  \u201cJust like people joined Facebook because everyone else was on Facebook, the biggest competitive advantage AT&T had was that it was interconnected,\u201d says Milton Mueller, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who has studied the history of technology policy.  Early in the 20th century, AT&T began buying up local competitors and refusing to connect independent exchanges to its long-distance lines, arousing antitrust complaints. By the 1920s, it was allowed to become a monopoly in exchange for universal service in the communities it served. By 1939, the company carried more than 90% of calls.  Though AT&T\u2019s research unit, Bell Labs, became synonymous with groundbreaking discoveries, in telephone innovation AT&T was a laggard. To protect its own lucrative equipment business it prohibited innovative devices such as the Hush-a-Phone, which kept others from overhearing calls, and the Carterphone, which patched calls over radio airwaves, from connecting to its network.  After AT&T was broken up into separate local and long-distance companies in 1982, telecommunication innovation blossomed, spreading to digital switching, fiber optics, cellphones\u2014and the internet.  Just as AT&T decided what equipment could be used on the nation\u2019s telephone systems, Google\u2019s search algorithms determine who can be found on the internet. If you searched for a toaster online in the mid 2000s, Google would probably have taken you to comparison shopping sites such as Nextag. They pioneered features such as showing consumer ratings in search results, how popular a product was and how prices had changed over time, recalls Gary Reback, an antitrust lawyer who represented several competitors against Google.  Google\u2019s Eric Schmidt testifying at a Senate Judiciary Committee antitrust hearing in September 2011. Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images  But when Google launched its own comparison business, Google Shopping, those sites found themselves dropping deeper into Google\u2019s search results. They accused Google of changing its algorithm to favor its own results. The company responded that its algorithm was designed to give customers the results they want. \u201cIf consumers don\u2019t like the answer that Google Search provides, they can switch to another search engine with just one click,\u201d Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt told Congress in 2011.  At that same hearing Jeffrey Katz, then the chief executive of Nextag, responded, \u201cThat is like saying move to Panama if you don\u2019t like the tax rate in America. It\u2019s a fake choice because no one has Google\u2019s scope or capabilities and consumers won\u2019t, don\u2019t, and in fact can\u2019t jump.\u201d  In 2013 the U.S. Federal Trade Commission concluded that even if Google had hurt competitors, it was to serve consumers better, and declined to bring a case. Since then, comparison sites such as Nextag have largely faded.  Last year the European Commission went in the other direction and fined the company $2.9 billion and ordered it to change its search results.  The different outcomes hinge in part on different approaches. European regulators are more likely to see a shrinking pool of competitors as inherently bad for both competition and consumers. American regulators are more open to the possibility that it could be natural and benign.  In new industries, smaller players are frequently bought up or vanquished by deeper-pocketed, more-innovative rivals. Google\u2019s general counsel, Kent Walker, wrote in response to the European Commission decision that even as smaller sites have retreated, Amazon has grown to become a huge player in comparison shopping.  Internet platforms have high fixed and minimal operating costs, which favors consolidation into a few deep-pocketed competitors. And the more customers a platform has, the more useful it is to each individual customer\u2014the \u201cnetwork effect.\u201d  But a platform that confers monopoly in one market can be leveraged to dominate another. Facebook\u2019s existing user base enabled it to become the world\u2019s largest photo-sharing site through its purchase of Instagram in 2012 and the largest instant-messaging provider through its purchase of WhatsApp in 2014. It is also muscling into virtual reality through its acquisition of Oculus VR in 2014 and anonymous polling with its purchase of TBH last year.  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg speaks at a developers conference last year in San Jose, Calif. Photo: Stephen Lam/REUTERS  What Facebook doesn\u2019t acquire, it copies. Snap Inc.\u2019s Snapchat, a fast-disappearing photo and video sharing app hugely popular with teenagers, was widely seen as a challenger to Facebook. But in 2016, Facebook introduced its own Snapchat-like feature, Stories, on Instagram, which now has more users and advertisers than Snapchat. That has undercut Snap\u2019s growth and profits by reducing the number of new users \u201cinterested in trying Snap for the first time,\u201d says Peter Stabler, an analyst at Wells Fargo.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with copying, especially if the copy is better than the original. Snapchat\u2019s app was originally difficult to use, says Mr. Stabler, and \u201cyou can\u2019t discount [Facebook\u2019s] quality of execution.\u201d Moreover, even as Facebook copies its competitors, it continues to expand and enhance its own services such as Pages, which 70 million businesses world-wide have used to design their own webpages on Facebook.  Snap\u2019s shares have sunk below the price at which the company went public last March as losses have mounted, which won\u2019t encourage new entrants. Once a company like Google or Facebook has critical mass, \u201cthe venture capital looks elsewhere,\u201d says Roger McNamee of Elevation Partners, a technology-focused private-equity firm. \u201cThere\u2019s no point taking on someone with a three or four years head start.\u201d  Amazon hasn\u2019t yet reached the same market share as Google or Facebook but its position is arguably even more impregnable because it enjoys both physical and technological barriers to entry. Its roughly 75 fulfillment centers and state-of-the art logistics (including robots) put it closer, in time and space, to customers than any other online retailer.  The company says size makes it possible to deliver millions of items free of shipping charges to isolated communities with little retail presence. Amazon makes that network available to third-party merchants who pay a 15% commission and, typically, a $3 pick-pack-and ship-fee, says Greg Mercer, founder of Jungle Scout Inc. which advises third-party merchants how to sell on Amazon. \u201cWe have tons of examples of small entrepreneurial-type people who are really good at creating new inventions but have no idea how to distribute to the masses,\u201d he says. \u201cThey create products and Amazon can take care of the rest.\u201d  An Amazon warehouse in Britain. Photo: Jane Barlow/PA Images/Getty Images  As the dominant platform for third-party online sales, Amazon also has access to data it can use to decide what products to sell itself. In 2016 Capitol Forum, a news service that investigates anticompetitive behavior, reported that when a shopper views an Amazon private-label clothing brand, the accompanying list of items labeled \u201cCustomers Who Bought This Item Also Bought,\u201d is also dominated by Amazon\u2019s private-label brands. This, it says, restricts competing sellers\u2019 access to a prime marketing space  Mr. Mercer says he doesn\u2019t see Amazon favoring its own products, and indeed his own firm helps merchants target profitable niches on Amazon. Nonetheless, he says many would prefer to sell through their own sites, but with so many shoppers searching first on Amazon, they feel they have little choice.  In the face of such accusations, the probability of regulatory action\u2014for now\u2014looks low, largely because U.S. regulators have a relatively high bar to clear: Do consumers suffer?  \u201cWe think consumer welfare is the right standard,\u201d Bruce Hoffman, the FTC\u2019s acting director of the bureau of competition, recently told a panel on antitrust law and innovation. \u201cWe have tried other standards. They were dismal failures.\u201d  Still, Ms. Scott Morton notes, \u201cthe consumer welfare standard covers today and tomorrow,\u201d and the potential loss of innovation is something both the law and the courts can and have weighed in an antitrust case. The Justice Department sued Microsoft to ensure that an innovation, the internet browser, remained a potential competitor to Microsoft\u2019s monopoly over the user\u2019s interface with the personal computer.  Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates appeared at an antitrust hearing in Washington federal court in 2002. Photo: STEPHEN JAFFE/AFP/Getty Images  What would remedies look like? Since Big Tech owes its network effects to data, one often-proposed fix is to give users ownership of their own data: the \u201csocial graph\u201d of connections on Facebook, or their search history on Google and Amazon. They could then take it to a competitor.  A more drastic remedy would be to block acquisitions of companies that might one day be a competing platform. British regulators let Facebook buy Instagram in part because Instagram didn\u2019t sell ads, which they argued made them different businesses. In fact, Facebook used Instagram to engage users longer and thus sell more ads, Ben Thompson, wrote in his technology newsletter Stratechery. Building a network is \u201cextremely difficult, but, once built, nearly impregnable. The only possible antidote is another network that draws away the one scarce resource: attention.\u201d Thus, maintaining competition on the internet requires keeping \u201csocial networks in separate competitive companies.\u201d  How sound are these premises? Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s access to that data and network effects might seem like an impregnable barrier, but the same appeared to be true of America Online\u2019s membership, Yahoo \u2019s search engine and Apple\u2019s iTunes store, note two economists, David Evans and Richard Schmalensee, in a recent paper. All saw their dominance recede in the face of disruptive competition. If someone launched a clearly superior search engine, social network or online store, consumers could switch more easily than they could telephone or oil companies a century ago. Microsoft has long dominated desktop operating systems but has failed to extend that dominance to internet search or to mobile operating systems.  It\u2019s possible Microsoft might have become the dominant company in search and mobile without the scrutiny the federal antitrust case brought. Throughout history, entrepreneurs have often needed the government\u2019s help to dislodge a monopolist\u2014and may one day need it again.

French President Emmanuel Macron attends a hearing to mark the beginning of the year in Paris on Monday. Photo: LUDOVIC MARIN, PRESS POOL  VERSAILLES, France\u2014French president Emmanuel Macron wined and dined Davos-bound business leaders inside the Palace of Versailles on Monday in an effort to shake off the country\u2019s image as a guillotine for foreign investment.  Some 140 executives, including Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai, met with Mr. Macron at the sprawling palace just outside Paris before traveling on to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  The event, dubbed \u201cChoose France\u201d by Mr. Macron, is an attempt to persuade business leaders that France has finally changed its ways. Long criticized as a land of excessive red-tape and government meddling in the private sector, France is striking a different pose under Mr. Macron.  The investment banker-turned-president has adopted myriad pro-business measures during his first eight months in office, from looser labor laws to tax cuts. Now he is under pressure to show these changes can spur investment.  So far the results are mixed. While the French economy is growing again and economists expect unemployment to fall in the coming months, the latest figures showed the jobless rate rose to 9.7% at the end of the third quarter of 2017 from 9.5% in the second.  Mr. Macron used the Versailles meeting to announce a handful of investment projects officials said are \u201csignificant or emblematic\u201d for France\u2019s economic future, in areas from auto manufacturing to technology.  Facebook pledged Monday to double the size of its artificial intelligence lab in France to 60 researchers. Google said it would open an artificial intelligence research center in France and confirmed plans to increase staff at its Paris office to just over 1,000 from 700. Toyota said it would invest \u20ac300 million (about $367.3 million) at a site in the north of France, creating 700 permanent jobs.  Prior to the summit, Mr. Macron told businesses leaders they would only be invited to Versailles if they came promising a new investment project.  \u201cIt\u2019s not about asking for advice on such and such measure. We\u2019re saying: come and invest in France and create jobs,\u201d a French official said ahead of the visit.  Surveys show Mr. Macron has reasons to be optimistic. An annual poll by Ipsos of 200 France-based executives at international firms showed in November that 60% consider the country an attractive place to do business compared to 36% a year earlier. According to the same poll, 62% say the government is overhauling the economy at the right pace compared to 2% in the fall of 2016.  \u201cThe proof is here that France has once again become attractive for the biggest foreign investors,\u201d said Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.  France\u2019s changing image, however, will take time to show in quantitative measures of investment and hiring as companies need to adjust to new labor laws and changes to tax, business leaders say. The French government is also worried the U.S. tax overhaul could make it less attractive for U.S. firms to invest in Europe.  Business leaders held short meetings with Mr. Macron\u2019s cabinet in the afternoon in a format officials describe as \u201cspeed dating.\u201d Before hosting a dinner with all the delegates, Mr. Macron had 20-minute one-on-one meetings with Ms. Sandberg, Mr. Pichai, Novartis Chief Executive Vasant Narisimhan and SAP SE Chief Executive Bill McDermott.

REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo  The settlement was filed on Monday in the federal court in Manhattan and won preliminary approval from U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet.  It amounts to a small fraction of Facebook\u2019s current market value of roughly $537 billion as of Monday\u2019s market close.  Shareholders led by the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System and Fresno County Employees\u2019 Retirement Association in California accused Facebook of concealing internal concerns about how growth in mobile devices might reduce revenue, even as it quietly warned its banks to cut their forecasts.  Unlike in 2012, the Menlo Park, California-based company now generates most of its revenue from mobile devices and has estimated that mobile advertising generated more than 86 percent of its $40.7 billion total revenue in 2017.  The settlement resolves claims against Facebook, officials including Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and director Peter Thiel, and bank underwriters covering a five-day period surrounding the $16 billion IPO, from May 17 to May 21, 2012.  Facebook made its market debut on May 18 of that year at $38 per share and saw its share price languish below that level for more than a year before it rebounded.  \u201cResolving this case is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders,\u201d Associate General Counsel Sandeep Solanki said in a statement.

The data scientist says 84 percent of Trump\u2019s budget asked people on Facebook to take an action, like donating, compared with 56 percent of Clinton\u2019s.  Facebook didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.  Trump ran 5.9 million different versions of ads during the presidential campaign and rapidly tested them to spread those that generated the most Facebook engagement, according to the paper. Clinton ran 66,000 different kinds of ads in the same period.  As is typical at Facebook, employees had access to the white paper, according to a person familiar with the matter. Employees routinely publish papers so colleagues can dig into issues facing the company and learn how certain products work.  A former Facebook employee cited the information from the white paper in a memo to Representative Adam Schiff\u2019s office in early March, saying it could help Congress ask the right questions about whether the campaign coordinated with Russia. For example, according to the paper, more than a quarter of Trump\u2019s ad spending was tied to third-party data files on voters, and leveraged a Facebook tool that helped the campaign show ads to people who looked similar to the names on file. Clinton\u2019s ads aimed for broader audiences, with only 4 percent of her Facebook spend on the lookalike tool.  \u201cDid Russian operatives give the Trump campaign a list of names to include or exclude from advertising that was running on Facebook?\u201d the former employee asked in the memo.  Republicans shut down the House of Representatives\u2019 investigation into Russia and Trump days later, \u201cleaving questions unanswered, leads unexplored, countless witnesses uncalled, subpoenas unissued,\u201d Schiff, a California Democrat, wrote on Twitter. A Schiff spokesman declined to comment for this story.  But Congress is still focusing on the use of third-party information on Facebook for another reason: the company\u2019s ensuing crisis over data on 50 million users obtained by Cambridge Analytica, a political advertising firm that helped Trump\u2019s campaign. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg is set to make his first congressional testimony on the issue in a matter of days.  One key question Zuckerberg is likely to face, raised in the former employee\u2019s memo to Schiff: What lists of Facebook users did Trump\u2019s campaign upload for advertising purposes?  Facebook is still working to unearth other information that congressional investigators have requested. The company is continuing to comb through its site to identify content posted by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian organization that used Facebook to manipulate public discourse in America ahead of the election. On Tuesday, the company took down more than 270 accounts and pages operated by the IRA that were used to spread messages to people in Russia and neighboring countries.  \u201cThis is the next step towards removing them from Facebook entirely,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote Tuesday on his Facebook page. \u201cOrganizations like the IRA are sophisticated adversaries who are constantly evolving, but we\u2019ll keep improving our techniques to stay ahead -- especially when it comes to protecting the integrity of elections.\u201d", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-03", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-03/trump-s-campaign-said-it-was-better-at-facebook-facebook-agrees"}, {"article": "Facebook Inc. must stop tracking Belgian users\u2019 surfing outside the social network and delete data it\u2019s already gathered, or it will face fines of 250,000 ($312,000) euros a day, a Belgian court ruled.  Facebook \u201cdoesn\u2019t sufficiently inform\u201d clients about the data it gathers on their broader web use, nor does it explain what it does with the information or say how long it stores it, the Brussels Court of First Instance said in a statement.  The social network is coming under increasing fire in Europe, with a high-profile German antitrust probe examining whether it unfairly compels users to sign up to restrictive privacy terms. Belgium\u2019s data-protection regulators have targeted the company since at least 2015 when a court ordered it to stop storing non-users\u2019 personal data. While the U.S. tech giant won an earlier appeal in 2016, Friday\u2019s ruling is the first in a European court to go to the heart of the company\u2019s use of technology deemed to be essential to its proper functioning.  Facebook uses cookies, social plug-ins -- the \"like\" or \"share\" buttons -- and pixels that are invisible to the naked eye to collect data on people\u2019s behavior during their visits to other sites, the court statement says, citing an investigation by Belgium\u2019s Privacy Commission that it said it backed fully.  \"Facebook can follow your surfing behavior without you realizing it, let alone want it, on the basis of those invisible pixels that Facebook has placed on more than 10,000 other websites,\" the court said.  The company is \"disappointed with today\u2019s verdict\u201d and intends to appeal, Facebook\u2019s head of public policy for Europe, Richard Allan, said. \u201cOver recent years we have worked hard to help people understand how we use cookies to keep Facebook secure and show them relevant content.\"  \"The cookies and pixels we use are industry standard technologies,\" Allan said. \"We require any business that uses our technologies to provide clear notice to end-users, and we give people the right to opt-out of having data collected on sites and apps off Facebook being used for ads.\"  Facebook must publish the 84-page ruling on its website and display extracts in Belgian newspapers within three months, a court spokeswoman said. It also rejected Facebook\u2019s arguments that a Belgian court couldn\u2019t rule on a business headquartered in the U.S. and which runs operations for the rest of the world from its Irish unit. The court said it was competent to rule on breaches of Belgian privacy law when the company tracks web users in Belgium.  \u2014 With assistance by John Martens", "stock": "FB", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-16", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-16/facebook-must-stop-tracking-belgian-web-users-court-rules"}, {"article": "Facebook Inc. reached a deal with Major League Baseball for exclusive rights to stream 25 afternoon games on the social network in the U.S.  It\u2019s the first time a major U.S. league has agreed to show regular season games exclusively on Facebook, which has been building a portfolio of live sports. MLB owners unanimously approved the move, the league said. Neither MLB nor Facebook disclosed the financial terms, though people with knowledge of the matter put the price at $30 million to $35 million. They asked not to be identified because the terms are private.  \u201cMuch like the migration of sports from broadcast to cable, you\u2019re reaching these milestones where the combination of the financial incentive and the audience allow you to make the next great leap,\u201d said Lee Berke, an industry consultant. \u201cThis is part of the next great leap.\u201d  The games add to Facebook\u2019s growing sports lineup. Last year, the company struck deals with Fox Sports to stream the UEFA Champions League and with Univision to broadcast live games from Mexico\u2019s top soccer league. The company also had 20 non-exclusive MLB games last season and acquired exclusive rights to stream 47 college basketball games involving smaller conferences this year.  With 1.4 billion active daily users, the world\u2019s biggest social network is also still growing, in contrast with conventional TV networks that have been losing viewers and advertising. Facebook\u2019s ad revenue last year totaled $40 billion.  Weekday Afternoons  All of the games will take place on weekday afternoons, primarily Wednesdays. The agreement begins with the April 4 game between the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Mets. Viewers will be able to watch on smartphones, tablets, computers and other connected devices, including home TVs.  The games will be produced by the MLB Network, meaning they\u2019ll have a broadcast look and feel. For Facebook, however, the rights allow for experimentation with things like social integration and graphics during the broadcast, enhancements popular with younger viewers drawn to digital platforms.  Facebook will also have rights to show the baseball games globally, though they won\u2019t be exclusive outside the U.S. MLB and Facebook will update the schedule on a monthly basis.  MLB will produce and distribute specially curated content, in addition to each live game broadcast, including on-demand highlight packages for every regular season game, as well as club-specific weekly recap packages for all 30 MLB teams. These will be available on Facebook Watch in the U.S. and around the world.  Football Rights  Earlier this year, Facebook opted against bidding for the National Football League\u2019s Thursday Night package, which Amazon.com Inc. carried last season. Facebook had bid the previous two years. The company did acquire the rights to NFL recaps and highlights, giving the league a way to reach fans on the social media service.  Facebook offered $600 million for the rights to an Indian cricket league, losing out to Fox, and has been boosting its budget for content, including live sports and original shows.  \u2014 With assistance by Gerry Smith", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-09", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-09/facebook-says-play-ball-in-exclusive-deal-to-stream-25-mlb-games"}, {"article": "David Kadavy used to post on Facebook without expecting to get paid. Then blockchain came along.  After stumbling onto a new corner of the internet based on the digital-ledger technology, Kadavy said he gets paid to post his blog and podcast on Steemit, a website whose text are saved on a blockchain. The site has its own digital currencies, the best-known of which is called Steem, and pays people such as Kadavy who post and comment on the site. Kadavy, a 38-year-old American writer living in Colombia, said he made about $2,000 in January.  \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in the Stone Age when I\u2019m on Facebook or Twitter,\u201d Kadavy said. \u201cThey have no value without what you\u2019re contributing to them. If Facebook doesn\u2019t respond to this, things can change very quickly. They should be very concerned.\u201d  The so-called financial internet stands the Facebook business model on its head. With Facebook, users post content on the site and the company collects the money -- last year, $41 billion in revenue. On Steemit, the money goes in the other direction. Facebook, with 2.1 billion monthly users, may not even see Steemit, which says 9 million users visit each month, in its rear-view mirror. But Kadavy is just one of hundreds of thousands of people who make money by posting, playing games and viewing ads on the new blockchain-based sites and apps, where nearly every user action is linked to token-based compensation.  More than 1,000 such projects that record data onto digital ledgers and are called dapps, for decentralized applications, are live or in testing. And they often let users earn their special coins or cryptocurrency by doing something they\u2019d already done for nothing on other sites.  Facebook and Twitter didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  Worth Dollars  Some pre-blockchain sites let users tip content creators from their own funds. Very few did. Sites like Steemit give content creators a portion of newly minted tokens that are being mined all the time. Most of the tokens can be traded on exchanges, so they\u2019re worth something in dollars. And like Steem, many of these coins have appreciated. Steem stands at $3.55, up from 11 cents a year ago.  Tokens are a big reason why two-year-old Steemit already has about 100,000 content creators, according to Chief Executive Officer Ned Scott. It just broke into the top 1,000 of the web\u2019s biggest sites, according to tracker Alexa.  Steem Token's Market Cap In the Past Year In Billions of Dollars Source: CoinMarketCap.com  \u201cI attribute almost all of Steemit\u2019s growth to the reality it\u2019s distributed money to members of the community,\u201d Scott said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s been very little marketing. It\u2019s been all organic conversations that have led to the growth of the platform. A majority of the people who continue to stick around are being compensated for their time.\u201d  Financial Internet in Infancy  Scott, a former financial analyst for a food-importing company, got Steemit off the ground with a $250,000 angel investment. The site doesn\u2019t sell ads. Instead, it owns a portion of the issued tokens.  This new financial Internet is still in its infancy. It pays users a total of $3.5 million, but within two years, users could be paid $50 million a year, according to Susan Eustis, CEO of WinterGreen Research. The market could expand to $180 million within five years, she said in an email. Billionaire investor Tim Draper said that tokens and cryptocurrencies will grab 33 percent of all commerce in the next 10 years.  Sites such as Facebook and Twitter could benefit immediately by allowing users to tip content providers in Bitcoin, Draper, one of the world\u2019s biggest investors in digital money, said in an email.  Money for Playing  While games such as Zynga Inc.\u2019s FarmVille have long used virtual currencies, the money can\u2019t be taken out of the games. That\u2019s not the case with tokens. Services like Bancor can convert an obscure token into one that can be traded on an exchange. In a sign of the financial internet\u2019s traction, conversion volume on the Bancor network has climbed to more than $37 million per week in January from $3 million per week in November, according to the company.  Startup Storj pays people to store files for others on unused hard-drive space. Golem will soon let users get paid for letting artists do renderings by using their computers\u2019 power. Users are already making money by taking polls and designing stickers for teen favorite Kik Messenger. Matchpool is set up to let people get paid for matching singles for dates, or for connecting companies with advisers. Augur, which is in beta testing, rewards users for correctly predicting future events. CryptoKitties, a digital game, is a platform for people to collect and breed virtual cats -- and to sell the virtual kittens.  Privacy Rules  CryptoKitties \u201cactually turned out to be my most profitable crypto asset,\u201d player Michael Rinderman, 26, said in an email. Since starting to play the game in early 2018, he turned an investment of one Ether into 10 Ethers; each Ether is currently worth $868.  Obstacles stand in the way of the financial internet. New privacy rules in Europe require sites to erase user information under certain circumstances. That could be problematic, as the blockchain is immutable and usually can\u2019t be changed easily.  Digital ledgers could also make it difficult to take down libelous content because it lives forever there, said Samit Singh, CEO of Decentralized News Network, an online publisher that\u2019s in alpha testing.  More importantly, most digital ledgers have problems scaling as more users jump on board. Recently, Ethereum blockchain screeched to a halt as too many users began playing CryptoKitties.  \u201cThese decentralized systems are just not made to grow and scale for the masses yet,\u201d said Anthony Di Iorio, co-founder of Ethereum, said in an interview. \u201cThere are always problems with early technology. It takes time.\u201d  But, he notes, it\u2019s worth the wait. \u201cThis will be more important than the internet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be massively disruptive for every sector.\u201d", "stock": "FB", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-27", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-27/websites-using-blockchain-to-pay-users-aim-to-disrupt-facebook"}, {"article": "\"Black Panther.\" Disney  Facebook has removed an anti-Disney Facebook group that planned to sabotage the Rotten Tomatoes audience score for Marvel's upcoming film \"Black Panther.\"  In December, the same group took credit for driving down the Rotten Tomatoes audience score for \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi.\"  Rotten Tomatoes also denounced the group in a statement on Thursday.

Facebook has spent the last several months working to eliminate fake news from users' feeds.  Former Facebook executives have also publicly condemned the platform as destructive to society.  Walmart and McDonald's may have negative effects on society, according to a new survey of 2,000 Americans, but Facebook beats them both.  Conducted by the research company Honest Data, the survey asked people to single out from a list of companies which ones they felt had the worst impacts on society. The companies included Marlboro, Walmart, Facebook, McDonald's, and Coca-Cola.  Facebook fit that criteria for 27% of respondents, coming in second behind Marlboro, which 43% of people said had negative effects. McDonald's and Walmart came in at 21% and 18%, respectively, while 36% of people said \"None of the above.\"  Tavis McGinn, founder of Honest Data, wrote on LinkedIn that the findings weren't entirely surprising, given how much negative press Facebook has received in recent months.  \"In the social sphere, people began to question the long-term impact of Facebook on the psychological well-being of users,\" McGinn wrote, noting that violent crimes and suicide have been broadcast on Facebook Live and that former Facebook executives have publicly condemned the platform as addictive and socially destructive.  The psychology research backs some of these claims up. Heavy users of social media have been shown to display greater rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal tendencies. The studies have managed to show the two factors aren't just correlated; social media appears to lead to negatives feelings.  \"Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, initially dismissed some of these concerns as a 'crazy idea' and instead tried promote the benefits of his social network,\" McGinn wrote. In defense, Zuckerberg also recently claimed people were spending 50 million fewer hours on Facebook due to various changes to the site.  \"But eventually, public opinion and dissatisfaction grew too loud to ignore,\" McGinn wrote.  A separate survey asking people which tech companies had negative effects on society found Facebook was the most common answer, followed closely by Twitter.

Attn: CEO Matthew Segal tells Business Insider that Facebook is emphasizing loyal audiences, interactivity, and longer episodes.  Starting in the fall, Facebook began to greenlight a handful of second seasons for its TV-like \"Watch\" shows. And now \"We Need to Talk,\" Attn:'s relationship advice series starring Nev Schulman (of \"Catfish\" fame) and his wife Laura Perlongo, has gotten a 10-episode order.  Business Insider talked to Attn: CEO Matthew Segal about what it took to get a renewal from Facebook, which has been selective about the series that have made it past season one. Segal said the most important factor was this: \"a loyal, repeat audience.\"  \"I know it's something that Facebook's looking at,\" Segal explained. \"Can viewers return from one episode to the next in the habitual way that implies fandom.\"  This makes sense when you consider what Facebook wants Watch to be. The tech giant is focused on making the Watch tab something that doesn't just rely on the same behavior as the news feed. Facebook wants people to check back for new episodes, like they do on YouTube or traditional TV. (One Watch partner told Business Insider that Facebook would prefer a show with fewer \"views,\" if the audience were coming back week after week, and didn't rely on the virality of a particular episode.)  Talk to your viewers  Segal said the other big factor was the \"interactivity\" of a show. This leans into Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's new mandate of promoting meaningful interactions.  \"Before we went into production on season one, we had Nev and Laura ask people\" what dating topics to cover, Segal said. And in season two, Attn: is going deeper into the fan feedback aspect.  \"For season two it's going to be even more interactive,\" Segal said. \"We are literally going to ask users to comment on their own experiences, and advice.\" Segal said the hosts will ask the audience about topics like how to ask people out, changing gender roles, money troubles, and so on. And there will be segments on the show when Nev and Laura are responding to reader feedback in real-time (though the episodes won't be live).  \"We Need to Talk\" isn't the only show that has used interactivity to find success.  According to a Watch partner, Mike Rowe's show \"Returning the Favor\" has been used by Facebook as an example of a show that's doing really well. Rowe asks for fan feedback on every show. \"We've already proven the best way to get people interested in RTF is to ask them to program each episode,\" he recently told Tubefilter.  Simply bigger  Season two of \"We Need to Talk\" will also be longer, with episodes falling more in the 10-12 minute range versus 3-6 minutes.  \"We've hired a whole writers room for this season, and there's lot of jokes peppered in,\" Segal said, though some of the show is unscripted as well.  There is definitely a bigger budget for this season, though Segal didn't comment on the exact figure. But in general, Facebook seems to be throwing more funding at shows it thinks can move the needle in terms of repeat viewers and interactivity.

Watch Snap's stock trade in real time here.    Snap shares were gaining ground after a report found that Facebook was losing younger users at a faster clip to Snapchat than previously expected.  Snap's stock was up 2.23% on Monday morning at $19.22 a share.  \"While the social media platform was able to count on Instagram to retain that younger audience in the past, Snapchat may now be siphoning away more users,\" according to the eMarketer study.  Social media companies have closely monitored millennials, particularly teenagers, because they represent a large base of sustainable growth.  Yet Facebook is still popular among older age groups, adding monthly users overall. The New York-based marketing firm eMarketer believes Facebook will add around 1% more users in 2018, compared to the previous year.  However, the study found that Facebook will lose 9.3% of US Facebook users between ages 11 and younger. Meanwhile, the number of Facebook users ages 12 to 17 will decline by 5.6% and users aged 18 to 24 will fall by 5.8% in 2018.

Desperate for the referral traffic Facebook dangled, they spent the past few years jumping through its hoops only to be cut out of the equation. Instead of developing an owned audience of homepage visitors and newsletter subscribers, they let Facebook brainwash readers into thinking it was their source of information.  Now Facebook is pushing into local news, but publishers should be wary of making the same crooked deal. It might provide more exposure and traffic for smaller outlets today, but it could teach users they only need to visit Facebook for local news in the future. Here\u2019s how Facebook retrained us over the past 12 years to drain the dollars out of news.  Users first is Facebook first later  To be clear, Facebook\u2019s intention, that I believe to be earnest, is to foster stronger ties between its users and their communities to boost well-being. But that doesn\u2019t mean ripple effects are positive. The critical lens through which to view all of Facebook\u2019s strategy is that in the short term it puts users first, itself second and everyone else a distant, distant third. That includes developers, advertisers and definitely news publishers.  This strategy is actually self-serving in the long term, though, because Facebook only continues to dominate because its users don\u2019t leave. Back in 2010, Facebook decimated the virality of game developers like Zynga, which made lots of money because their News Feed spam threatened to push people away from the social network. That short-term hit to the bottom line paved the way for the depth of engagement that fuels quarters where Facebook earns $4 billion today.  This explains CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s recent announcement that Facebook would make changes to enhance well-being even if it decreased time spent on the site or its ad revenue. Those consequences may be true in the short term. But it\u2019s a shrewd tactic when you zoom out. Left unchecked, the \u201cTime Well Spent\u201d movement could metastasize into a \u201cTime to leave Facebook\u201d movement. Better to trade away a few minutes per day per user now to keep those users for years to come.  Retraining news readers  When Facebook started, there was no feed. You browsed from profile to profile to check up on friends. News Feed\u2019s launch in 2006 retrained users to just go to the Facebook home page where everything would come to you. Brands followed, investing to build an audience through Facebook\u2019s churning stream of content.  As Facebook\u2019s users shifted from PCs and Macs to Androids and iPhones, the company struck upon an enduring format for mobile. Desktop computers had big enough screens to accomodate multiple windows, and switching between browser tabs was quick, allowing users to easily hop between different sites. But on mobile with tiny screens, low quality app, poor connections, slow-loading sites, people seized upon Facebook\u2019s single app that pulled together content from everywhere. Facebook began to train us to keep scrolling rather than struggle to bounce around.  In 2011, when Facebook first took notice of Twitter, it launched its public figure Subscribe feature and news links gained more visibility in the feed. By 2014, \u201cFacebook the big news machine\u201d was in full swing with Trending, hashtags and news outlets pouring resources into growing their Pages. Emphasizing the \u201cnews\u201d in News Feed retrained users to wait for the big world-changing headlines to come to them rather than crisscrossing the home pages of various publishers. Many don\u2019t even click-through, getting the gist of the news just from the headline and preview blurb. Advertisers followed the eyeballs, moving their spend from the publisher sites to Facebook.  In 2015, Facebook realized users hated waiting for slow mobile websites to load, so it launched Instant Articles to host publisher content within its own app. Instant Articles trained users not to even visit news sites when they clicked their links, instead only having the patience for a fast-loading native page stripped of the publisher\u2019s identity and many of their recirculation and monetization opportunities. Advertisers followed, as publishers allowed Facebook to sell the ads on Instant Articles for them and thereby surrendered their advertiser relationships at the same time as their reader relationships.  This is how Facebook turns publishers into ghostwriters, a problem I blew the whistle on in 2015. Publishers are pitted against each other as they make interchangeable \u201cdumb content\u201d for Facebook\u2019s \u201csmart pipes.\u201d  Publishers wisely began pushing back, demanding more layout and monetization flexibility, and many abandoned the platform in favor of Google\u2019s less prescriptive AMP platform for fast-loading mobile pages. In fact, 38 of 72 Instant Articles launch partner publications including the New York Times and Washington Post have ditched the Facebook controlled format according to a study by Columbia Journalism Review.  Still, publishers have few major sources of traffic outside of Facebook and Google Search. With the death of Google Reader and Twitter\u2019s move to an algorithmic feed, there\u2019s still no at-scale, unfiltered place to share or follow news. If people do want a more direct relationship with news, they should get on Feedly or another RSS readers, or add a few favorite sites to their browser\u2019s bookmark bar.  Meanwhile, Facebook\u2019s only goal remains to provide value to users, and when it comes to content, it doesn\u2019t really care which publisher provides it as long as it\u2019s high-quality.  Siphoning resources to the center  Again and again, Facebook has centralized attention typically spread across the web. A few years back I wrote about \u201c20 New Ways Facebook Is Eating The Internet,\u201d and its appetite has only grown. It\u2019s trying to do the same with Watch (YouTube), Marketplace (Craigslist and eBay) and many other features. It\u2019s a smart plan that ends up arguably improving the experience for individual users \u2014 or at least offering new options while making Facebook more essential and much richer.  The problem is that for society as a whole, this leads to a demonetization and eventual defunding of some news publishers, content creators and utility providers while simultaneously making them heavily reliant on Facebook. This gives Facebook the power to decide what types of content, what topics, and what sources are important. Even if Facebook believes itself to be a neutral tech platform, it implicitly plays the role of media company as its values define the feed. Having a single editor\u2019s fallible algorithms determine the news consumption of the wired world is a precarious situation.  The business side is just as troubling. As Ben Thompson of Stratechery has described, advertisers are abandoning news sites and aggregating to Facebook where they can more efficiently target their exact customers, where they go every day. Why advertise on an intermediary news site when businesses can go straight to well of attention. Without the massive scale and adtech, individual publishers can\u2019t compete for dollars.  But if they resist working with Facebook and providing their content there, another publisher will happily bring the same stories to the social network in return for the short-term traffic boost. There\u2019s always someone else willing to offer up dumb content to the smart pipe.  Steamrolled by strategy change  And the real problem only manifests when Facebook shifts directions. Its comes to the conclusion that users want to see more video, so the format gets more visibility in the News Feed. Soon, publishers scramble to pivot to video, hiring teams and buying expensive equipment so they can blast the content on Facebook rather than thinking about their loyal site visitors. But then Facebook decides too much passive video is bad for you or isn\u2019t interesting, so its News Feed visibility is curtailed, and publishers have wasted their resources and time chasing a white rabbit\u2026 or, in this case, a blue one.  This happened to Page tab apps like musician profile provider BandPage, which was the No. 2 app on Facebook until Facebook banned default landing tabs. The startup lost 90 percent of its traffic after wasting years chasing Facebook\u2019s changes, and eventually sold for $8 million after raising $27 million. Open Graph news reader apps met the same fate, built by publishers to meet the opportunity of Facebook\u2019s short-lived Ticker and \u201cJosh read [clickbait article] on Washington Post Social Reader\u201d stories.  Publishers are currently caught amidst of another massive Facebook strategy change. It\u2019s now striving to offset Russian election interference, fake news for profit, allegations of political bias, polarized society, the explosion of viral video, the absence of friends, and fears that too much scrolling hurts our well-being. That\u2019s led to Facebook proclaiming it will remove 20% of news from the News Feed as it prioritizes content that\u2019s not just meaningful, but stimulates meaningful interactions between users.  On this week\u2019s Q4 2017 earnings call, Zuckerberg said Facebook had already tweaked its algorithm to show fewer viral videos and optimize well-being. The result was a 50 million hours per day reduction in Facebook use, which translates to 2.14 minutes per daily user, or 5 percent of total time spent on Facebook. The company was willing to go so far as to make changes that led to its slowest ever user growth rate, and its first decline in total users anywhere as the U.S. & Canada region actually lost 700,000 Facebookers.  Yet it\u2019s the video makers and news publishers who will pay for this pivot of purpose. Facebook\u2019s revenue still reached a record $12.97 billion, and investors still boosted its share price higher. In fact, Facebook could actually earn money or at least break even from the \u201cTime Well Spent\u201d changes.  By decreasing total time spent but raising the quality of content people see, Facebook ends up with fewer total ad impressions but higher engagement rates as people are retrained to skip less of what they see. Advertisers still eager to reach its massive audience will compete in Facebook\u2019s ad auctions, paying higher prices. Facebook has the cash reserves and momentum to weather the short-term monetization drop in exchange for a healthier long-term future. Content creators are left trying to make ends meet.  [Update 2/4/2018: Zuckerberg discussed Facebook\u2019s ability to persevere despite mistakes in his post about the company\u2019s 14th birthday. \u201cOver the years I\u2019ve made almost every mistake you can imagine . . . I\u2019ve missed important trends and I\u2019ve been slow to others. I\u2019ve launched product after product that failed. The reason our community exists today is not because we avoid mistakes. It\u2019s because we believe what we\u2019re doing matters enough to keep trying\u201d. The issue is that other less secure and successful businesses like newsrooms don\u2019t have the resources to undertake trial and error at the scale necessary to keep up with Facebook\u2019s changes.]  Stay the course  And now local news site are facing the start of this dangerous cycle. Facebook says it will show more local news in the News Feed. It\u2019s testing a \u201cToday in\u201d local news digest in several cities. It\u2019s prioritizing content people discuss instead of passively consume. And Facebook is pushing its new mission to rebuild communities and Bring the World Closer Together that aligns with local news.  Sounds great, right? There\u2019s no doubt there\u2019s an opportunity here for local news outlets. But the key to keeping their boats afloat is not completely changing course to follow Facebook\u2019s siren call. Whether or not you think the company is purposefully trying to destroy the industries it invades or just modernize them to benefit users, publishers must meet Facebook with skepticism.  Facebook\u2019s next retraining appears to be that it\u2019s the best place to get local news, not your local newspaper or blog. It might happily display all the headlines with little encouragement for readers to click through, as it does with Today On. It might make images and videos load faster than they do on local sites. And they might bundle local news with Facebook Events and reviews of nearby places using personalization local sites can\u2019t match.  That might be good for the reader, and thereby for Facebook long term, but it\u2019s dangerous for the publishers. Facebook doesn\u2019t even have to purposefully poach advertisers from local sites, they\u2019ll just flow to it naturally as it becomes the local news destination.  They should still focus on turning occasional readers into repeat homepage visitors that bookmark the site and return frequently. They should track analytics about what kinds of stories those loyalists want, rather than the ones that might drive occasional traffic spikes of fly-by readers. They should invest in developing their own ad technology or partnering with more neutral third-party providers. And they should keep pushing email newsletter, event and subscription signups.  That\u2019s because there\u2019s no telling when Facebook\u2019s strategy around what users want or how to give it to them will change. Again, Facebook wants users to be informed and entertained, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily care how or by whom. And let\u2019s not forget that Facebook is quietly building up its Marketplace peer-to-peer selling feature in another part of its app to be the ultimate replacement for the classified ads that used to keep local news sites afloat.  Unfortunately, big, well-funded publishers staffed with true tech talent haven\u2019t been able to gracefully navigate the constantly changing playing field set by Facebook. So what hope do smaller outlets without the technological or strategic prowess hope to have?  In Zuckerberg\u2019s hometown of Dobbs Ferry, NY, there\u2019s a beloved newspaper called The Rivertowns Enterprise. It\u2019s a destination for those seeking local news, with a loyal following for both its website and its weekly print edition, which many who grew up there get delivered to their homes around the country. Visit its site and you\u2019ll stumble across a variety of stories about city politics, high school sports and Main Street businesses that also advertise there.  But as Facebook turns its eyes toward local news as an answer to larger problems with well-being, false information and polarized communities, it also poses a threat to The Rivertowns Enterprise and outlets like it. The inevitable march of technological progress was merely accelerated by the dominant social network. But for now those publishers\u2019 best bet is to take a page from Facebook if they\u2019re going to survive: Put your own readers and your long-term viability first instead of gambling on short-lived favors.", "stock": "FB", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-03", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/03/facebooks-siren-call/"}, {"article": "Facebook has a new executive coming on to unify its research efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.

The \u201cFacebook Container,\u201d as the new extension is called, isolates your Facebook identity from the rest of the web. That means Facebook will not be able to use your other web activity to send your targeted advertising.  To be clear, this extension wouldn\u2019t have saved users\u2019 data from being compromised as it was in the Cambridge Analytica scandal; and it does nothing to prevent Facebook advertisers from diving into your profile and your activity while on the social network in order to target you with advertisements while browsing Facebook.  However, it is meant to plug at least one of the holes in Facebook\u2019s leaky dam by offering a way for users to prevent Facebook from gaining even more data collected outside its service.  \u201cContainers are a feature built into the Firefox platform that separate user cookies and site data into different cookie jars,\u201d explains Jeff Griffiths, Product Lead for Firefox. \u201cFor Facebook Container specifically, this means that a user should only be able to log in in the Facebook Container. Facebook cookies and site data that identify the user are only available to that Container, and only Facebook can be open in that Container,\u201d he says.  When you install the new extension, it deletes your Facebook cookies and logs you out of the social network. The next time you open Facebook, you\u2019ll notice it\u2019s been opened in a blue-colored \u201ccontainer\u201d tab.  From within that tab, you can continue to use Facebook normally. However, if you click a link that would take you to a page off of Facebook, it will load the URL outside the container. Similarly, if you click any Facebook Share buttons outside of Facebook, it will load those in the Facebook container. (But this will send information to Facebook about the website you shared them from, it should be noted.)  In addition, you may not be able to login to third-party apps with your Facebook credentials, and the embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons you see around the web won\u2019t work either.  \u201cThis prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity,\u201d explains The Firefox Frontier blog. \u201cSo it may look different than what you are used to seeing.\u201d  Actually, it may surprise you to find out how widespread your use of Facebook was when outside the social network.  Facebook\u2019s platform and its off-site advertising network allow other sites and apps to access users\u2019 Facebook data even when users aren\u2019t on Facebook itself. Facebook is hardly alone in terms of companies doing this. But it is making headlines over data mishandling, which means it\u2019s a good time for Mozilla to capitalize on consumers\u2019 concerns to share their messages \u2013 and tools \u2013 focused on data privacy.  Mozilla said it sped up its work on the Facebook Container add-on, which is based on technology it\u2019s been developing over the past couple of years, as it\u2019s seen increasing consumer demand for tools for managing privacy and security.  There are other tools available to help consumers with these issues today, as well, including the Ghostery anti-tracking extension now owned by Cliqz, ad blockers (including those bundled with browsers like Safari), and more.

Photo  Back Story  On this day in 1887, Harvey Wilcox, a real estate developer from Kansas, filed a plan with Los Angeles County for a small, gridded subdivision that he called Hollywood. (The origin of the name is a subject of dispute.)  Over the next decade, Mr. Wilcox and his wife, Daeida, conjured out of the desert a strict Christian community of orchards and Victorian cottages, connected to Los Angeles by a lone streetcar line.  Photo  There were just a few hundred residents, and the hamlet banned alcohol, bowling alleys and even, briefly, movie theaters. But in 1910, Hollywood voted to merge with Los Angeles.  Soon, movie studios fled the enforcement of Thomas Edison\u2019s monopoly on film patents and started setting up in the ideal Southern California light.  In 1923, the Hollywoodland sign went up (it was truncated to Hollywood in 1949). The original sign was an illuminated billboard for a segregated housing development that called itself a fortress against \u201cmetropolitanism\u201d; one ad urged, \u201cProtect your family.\u201d  The sign was left up as the so-called Golden Age of Hollywood arrived, a noirish era embodied by the starlet Peg Entwistle, who jumped to her death from the H in 1932.

Facebook also offers to work with schools to bring online safety lessons into the classroom. This is a sensible move to help kids learn how to protect themselves, but also helps raise the site's profile among school kids.

Facebook Product Manager Aykud G\u00f6nen said in a blog post the 3D objects use \u201cindustry-standard gITF 2.0\u201d formatting, and that artists will be able to directly drag and drop 3D images into Facebook posts.

Now, Facebook is looking to get even more mixed in with a new Software Development Kit (SDK) that puts a strong emphasis on game streaming, especially on the popular front of PC gaming. And, this isn't Facebook's first shot at game streaming, either.  For developers, the new SDK is positioned as a way to draw in more community engagement and get gamers sharing. It will also offer them analytics on gamer activity.  But, livestreaming is clearly positioned front and center. With solo streamers setting records on Twitch, it's a market plenty want to get a bite of. Twitch, YouTube and Mixer are all competing for the same pie. Now, Facebook is working on getting itself a good slice.  PC Game developers can also now reward viewers  Only last January, Facebook landed an exclusive eSports streaming deal with the ESL for Dota 2 and Counter Strike: Global Offensive competitions. The new SDK has the possibility of bringing even more livestreams to Facebook.  A particular advantage the SDK has is that it doesn't require any extra special software or hardware to handle the streams, lowering the barrier of entry for gamers to put their streams in front of viewers. It will also enable a clipping feature similar to the social sharing seen on Sony and Microsoft consoles.  While much hinges on how many developers make use of the new SDK, it's likely to give Facebook a little more firepower against its stiff competition. The new SDK will be available for developers soon, and applies to mobile, PC and console gaming.

If you have one gadget and don't use the internet much, in Facebook's eyes you're probably a poor person.  Facebook's application says the algorithm is intended for use by \"third parties to increase awareness about products or services to online system users.\" Examples given include corporations and charities.  The patent essentially tells us that Facebook intends to add class to its advertising preferences. You know, the ones that until very recently allowed advertisers to filter by race and ethnicity, which they dragged their feet about fixing, and still hovers in the realm of \"temporarily disabled.\"  The patent's illustrations tells us a story. It's a tale of upper-class employees indoctrinated, sheltered, and inoculated from outside thinking. Facebook has been literally sitting there going \"what does it mean to be middle class\", defining it themselves, and getting excited about who they can sell class information to.  I love it when a company tells us more about itself like this. \"Working class\" is at the bottom of its graphs. Its idea of \"middle class\" is a homeowner in the cash-soaked city of Palo Alto; its artwork suggests that home ownership in San Jose is surely a lower-class indicator. Af if to say, who would buy a home there?  Facebook has *no* idea what \"middle class\" means, apparently: pic.twitter.com/GK1drH0Q53 \u2014 Stephen Canon (@stephentyrone) February 4, 2018  Looking at the patent's details, I can also imagine how this sets Facebook up to assign particular locations (like restaurants) or objects (brand names or items) to a socioeconomic class.  Meaning, it's not a stretch to think that Facebook will be able to decide from check-ins which restaurants, phones, and brands of shoes, are \"lower class.\"  Oops -- I meant to write \"working class.\" Really.  Open season on opportunity hoarding  Leave it to Facebook to race ahead of Black Mirror. In light of Facebook's recent announcement to focus on more \"concrete local issues\" it's not too hard to imagine how this could be used to keep working class renters out of a particular neighborhood, to facilitate predatory lending, or make sure that lower classes don't see your dating service ads.  This is not a new problem; Facebook is just 'improving' it. After reading the 2014 White House report on data, privacy, algorithms, and discrimination, Google engineer Jeremy Kun wrote:  Here's a not-so-imaginary example of the problem. A bank wants people to take loans with high interest rates, and it also serves ads for these loans. A modern idea is to use an algorithm to decide, based on the sliver of known information about a user visiting a website, which advertisement to present that gives the largest chance of the user clicking on it.  The bank then makes a tasty little ad offering much-needed money for little up front, and the algorithm takes over. Target the lower class, the working class -- which are often people of color, too -- because data shows poor people (those least in a position to take high-interest loans) are more likely than the general population to be so desperate that they'll take on a bad loan.  Kun explains, \"So an algorithm that is 'just' trying to maximize clickthrough may also be targeting black people, de facto denying them opportunities for fair loans.\"  According to Kun, under US law, a practice can be considered discriminatory \"even in the absence of intent.\" In comments he added:  E.g. if people in poorer neighborhoods are disproportionately shown ads for predatory loans because an algorithm decided it has higher clickthrough. They have fewer chances for a fair loan treatment because they aren't exposed to normal loan offers. Is that direct or indirect? In either case, it's illegal. Even if a practice is not racist by intention, it can have an disproportionate adverse impact on a particular racial class, and so it's still considered illegal.  Facebook's algorithm may not be making illegal decisions, but it is absolutely facilitating humans to do so. Welcoming them to it, actually. Not that Facebook lets the law deter them from making a buck. I mean, c'mon.  It's not too hard to think of ways Russia's state-sponsored propaganda trolls will use this new feature either.  Stay classy, Facebook  Well, you're saying, it's just an updated version of Facebook's patent to help lenders discriminate against borrowers based on social connections, isn't it? Which was the inspiration for the parody app, \"Unfriend the Poors.\" And maybe now isn't such a ridiculous idea after all in a reality where you'll probably want to unfriend your mom to raise your credit score before you click on that Facebook ad.  It's hard to keep writing these things off like some sort of idealistic upper class privilege gone awry in a company that surely has tricked some good people into working there, but whose culture and rulebook defends holocaust denial as free speech. A company that is failing to curb a proliferation of users who advocate for, and until recently bought ads that endorse, soft-peddled ethnic cleansing. Just another of Facebook's naive evils cross-fading into another.  Facebook tells us that it considers itself a moral company. But we know. We know that Facebook upsets the moral order because it continues to act perilously, without impunity.  So what have we learned this week? We've learned that the working class that actually exists isn't anything like the fantasies and prejudices of affluent, sheltered Facebook employees. Like the ones who've been hoarding buildings in working-class San Francisco neighborhoods, putting local small business owners out of business.  And if they wanted to escape those fantasies and prejudices to find out what we're all really experiencing, their best bet would be to quit their jobs at Facebook and to go get actual working-class jobs (and be subjected to the other side of the Facebook experience as well).  It may not give them an actual clue. But at least we wouldn't have to put up with them destroying democracy and its foundational principle of equality anymore.

Now the mobs are howling after Facebook , Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s creature.  It is true that Facebook\u2019s release of personal \u201cfriend data\u201d into the ozone through Cambridge Analytica remains in the news only because of the prevailing superstition that the Facebook monster allowed Donald Trump to be elected president. The idea that omnipotent technology manipulated the 2016 election has greater appeal to advanced progressive thinking than Hillary Clinton\u2019s explanation that married white women sold her out.  But really, all that is a sideshow. The backlash against this technology, the belief that the creature must be controlled, has been building for several years. Along with Google, Facebook is the biggest web target, so Mark Zuckerberg is about to get torched by Congress and any regulator within reach for abusing \u201cdata.\u201d  Data is the oxygen of the internet. Any online click for any reason inputs data. In the beginning this data, organized into things like family Facebook groups or Google Maps or Wikipedia, was seen as good.  For several years BTTP\u2014BTTP being human history Before The Trump Presidency \u2014articles and books poured forth describing the dark side of this technology. In the past year, that criticism has reached critical mass.  Researchers and parents agree that social media is distorting the lives of young people, especially adolescent girls. No one knows what to do about it.  Web forums fill with millions of young men exchanging sexual and political rants. No one knows what to do about it.  Terrorists wallow in jihadist videos on YouTube, brainwashing themselves into acts of mass murder. No one knows what to do about it.  People write articles saying they have forgotten how to read books.  Major advertisers accuse social-media companies of allowing their ads to appear alongside pornography, a bog beyond anyone\u2019s control.  The cyberwarfare spies of Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency ran around the U.S. uncaught for years.  Social media\u2019s contribution to the Arab Spring and Ukraine\u2019s Orange Revolution was an era ago. The technology has been captured since by dictators who use it as an instrument of surveillance and control that would startle Philip K. Dick.  In one week, Facebook the good communitarian has become Facebook the abuser of everyone\u2019s privacy.  The story of Frankenstein endures as a metaphor of good intentions gone haywire because it keeps happening. Some people used to argue that because Albert Einstein explained how energy could be released from atoms, he bore responsibility for the atomic bomb. By this logic blame should fall on Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, for electing Donald Trump.  Do not for a moment think that Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Berners-Lee or any of the others who created modern life online are unaware that history may conclude their creations were a mistake.  Mr. Berners-Lee, reacting to the Facebook mess, accused social-media companies of abusing his creation: \u201cThe fact that power is concentrated among so few companies has made it possible to weaponize the web at scale.\u201d  \u201cWeaponize\u201d evokes the idea of dual-use technology, which is tech that can be put to both a peaceful and military purpose, such as rocket guidance systems. The internet has finally been recognized as a dual-use technology, good and bad.  Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO and inheritor of Steve Jobs\u2019s creations, weighed in this week, ironically from China, the global leader in Orwellian surveillance systems. \u201cThe ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years,\u201d said Mr. Cook, \u201cwho your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life\u2014from my own point of view it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d Of course, the iPhone became the universal gateway into this dystopia.  One can imagine that when Sergey Brin and Larry Page created Google\u2019s early motto, \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil,\u201d they sensed what Robert Oppenheimer and his colleagues on the Manhattan Project knew: The power of what they had created might be a problem.  Back when superstition ruled the world, the solution to a larger-than-life problem was known as forcing the genie back into the bottle. Today, when algorithms rule the world, one would think that an industry with aggregate IQ greater than any ever assembled could figure this out. But maybe IQ correlates with the problem.  If the issue is privacy, why does every app and site incentivize users to scroll past pages of legal boilerplate to hit \u201cI Agree,\u201d rather than writing up top in large type: \u201cTHIS IS THE ONE SENTENCE YOU\u2019VE GOTTA THINK ABOUT BEFORE YOU AGREE\u201d?

Facebook co-founder, Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill, April 11. Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images  Members of Congress took turns lashing Mark Zuckerberg this week for Facebook \u2019s myriad screw-ups. The CEO showed contrition, but his apologia has raised important questions about the government\u2019s failures.  Democrats who were once enthralled with Silicon Valley fell out of love with Facebook following reports that Russian trolls used its platform to promulgate fake news and ads to support Donald Trump in 2016. Then came news that a political firm linked to the Trump campaign may have misappropriated data on 270,000 users and their 87 million friends collected by a third-party app.  Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s defense? Facebook was too \u201ctrusting.\u201d After the Guardian newspaper reported in 2015 that a Cambridge University researcher had shared data from his personality-quiz app with the political firm Cambridge Analytica , Facebook asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data. Cambridge Analytica said it had, and Facebook accepted its word.  The incident demonstrated that Facebook\u2019s privacy protections were flimsier than it claimed. In 2011 Facebook settled charges with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over mishandling user data, and Facebook agreed to establish stronger privacy protections and obtain periodic third-party audits. But Facebook has now disclosed that tens of thousands of apps may have obtained data on users and their friends beyond what they needed to operate.  This seems to violate the FTC\u2019s consent decree, as Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal noted. Mr. Zuckerberg waffled in reply that \u201cit certainly appears that we should have been aware that [the researcher] submitted a term that was in conflict with the rules of the platform.\u201d But he said the third-party audits didn\u2019t turn up problems.  The FTC is now investigating Facebook\u2019s privacy controls, but a few questions: Why didn\u2019t the commission ensure years ago that Facebook had established policies to prevent third-party apps from repurposing data? Was the agency too trusting? The Obama campaign app in 2012 exploited data from users and their friends. This may also have violated the FTC consent decree, especially if it shared the data with other liberal groups. Did political considerations influence the FTC\u2019s lax oversight?  These are important questions since Democrats are pressing for more stringent privacy regulations, which Mr. Zuckerberg said he\u2019s open to. But regulation typically benefits incumbents like Facebook that can afford to spend more on compliance while tripping up small competitors. Before establishing new regulations, the FTC should ensure that tech companies abide by their own policies.  Mr. Zuckerberg was also keelhauled for letting Russians exploit the platform in 2016. Facebook has since identified 470 pages and accounts linked to the Russian-controlled Internet Research Agency, which generated at least 200,000 pieces of content over two years. The Russian outfit also bought 3,000 ads on Facebook and Instagram.  The spread of fake news was partly due to Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s refusal to exercise editorial control over content or pay for quality news. Employing people to sift out junk is expensive, though the increased regulation that may come if he doesn\u2019t also isn\u2019t cheap.  But Facebook can\u2019t be held entirely responsible for Russia\u2019s interference. Only the Justice Department can see across media channels and has the power to investigate election fraud, as special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s indictment of 13 Russians in February showed.  The Russians began organizing in 2013 and stole American identities. \u201cBeginning in or around June 2014, and continuing into June 2015, public reporting began to identify operations conducted by the [IRA] in the United States,\u201d the indictment says. The Russian operatives also created fake accounts on Twitter and YouTube. Yet the Obama Administration waited until December 2016 to slap sanctions on Russians for hacking Democratic National Committee emails. It doesn\u2019t appear that social- media interference was ever a priority.  While Facebook has endorsed legislation that would require more disclosure for buyers of political ads, the regulatory burden could make it harder for small companies and blogs to sell ads. This could drive more political advertising to Facebook. And it\u2019s unclear how the legislation would prevent identity fraud.  Democrats are bitter that President Trump won the election and are using Facebook as a scapegoat.

Instagram, left, and Facebook, right, used to feel like two distinct digital experiences, but they feel increasingly similar as Instagram adopts Facebook-style recommendations and notifications. Shown, the apps on iPhone X screens. Photo: Emily Prapuolenis/The Wall Street Journal  I use Facebook , FB 0.40% like most people, but I often say my real self is on Instagram.  On Facebook, I share major life changes and links to articles I\u2019ve written. But that long, emotional post from the refugee camp in Greece where I volunteered? Or the picture where I\u2019m dressed up as the late Chicago Cubs announcer Harry Caray for Halloween? Instagram all the way.  Facebook Inc. has owned Instagram since 2012 but until recently the social network and the photo-sharing app have felt like distinct experiences. For years, Instagram was a haven from Facebook\u2019s annoying ads, creepy friend suggestions and viral clickbait. Meanwhile, Facebook has begun to draw fire as a potential menace to mental health and stable democracies alike.  So it\u2019s a little surprising that recent Instagram updates make it feel much more like its big brother. Sure, when Instagram has taken a page from Facebook\u2019s playbook in the past, it has paid off: Switching from a chronological feed to an algorithm increased engagement.  And Instagram\u2019s user base continues to grow. Monthly active users doubled to 800 million from February to September last year; the app had 500 million daily active users as of September.  But lately even Instagram\u2019s owner has acknowledged the distinction between a habitual user and a happy user. The latest updates may get people into Instagram more frequently, or for a longer time, but there\u2019s little to enjoy about them. Here\u2019s why I\u2019m falling out of love with one of my favorite apps.  Recommended Garbage  Part of what made Instagram great was that your main feed was a stream of things you wanted to see: pictures and videos from friends and accounts whose posts you enjoy. The Facebook-type noise\u2014stuff your friends had commented on, public chatter\u2014remained in other tabs you could click over to if you felt like it.  A few weeks ago, I was scrolling through Instagram, minding my own business, when a random picture of a man showed up, posted by an account I\u2019d never heard of. For a split second, I thought I was in someone else\u2019s account.  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  Starting in December, Instagram has been putting posts from people you don\u2019t follow right into your feed, under a \u201cRecommended for you\u201d banner.  They are sandwiched between your feed\u2019s new posts and previously viewed ones. If you tap the three dots on the right side of the banner, you can hide these posts temporarily, but you can\u2019t opt out of them entirely.  An Instagram spokeswoman said the feature \u201cmakes it easier to find relevant, high-quality content and accounts you wouldn\u2019t normally see but might enjoy.\u201d  Research has shown that when we see Facebook content from people we don\u2019t know, it can enhance the feeling that others are living better lives. One study found that when people used Facebook passively\u2014scrolling but not commenting, liking or posting\u2014their feelings of envy increased.  Even Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has weighed in: He recently told investors he wants the company \u201cto encourage meaningful social interactions.\u201d Instagram\u2019s recommended posts are the opposite of meaningful.  Post, Post, Ad  I can now make it through three new posts on Instagram before seeing an ad. After that, I get one every six to eight posts.  Instagram\u2019s spokeswoman confirmed ad load is up: \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to do this by improving the quality and the relevance of the ads.\u201d  But the ad load feels way up. According to the social advertising firm Brand Networks, clients delivered 17 times as many ad impressions on Instagram in 2017 as in 2016. The company, which works with brands including American Express Co. and Unilever PLC, expects Instagram impressions to grow by 25% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with the previous quarter.  Instagram may be free, but you\u2019re paying for it with your constantly interrupted attention.  Nowhere to Hide  Earlier this month, Instagram\u2019s direct messages started showing when users were last active.  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  While a lot of people are fine with such a feature\u2014closely related to the instant-message read receipt\u2014others feel it is intrusive. You can disable the feature in settings, but it\u2019s on by default.  The Instagram spokeswoman says the feature allows for \u201cmore of a real-time experience.\u201d  People reeled when Facebook made them download a separate Messenger app, which has since become larded up with too many such real-time features. That may be a harbinger of things to come for Instagram, which is testing a stand-alone camera-first messaging app in six countries outside the U.S.  People You Don\u2019t Want to Know  Facebook\u2019s \u201cPeople you may know\u201d feature, which suggests who you might want to friend, is known for being creepy. Facebook says suggestions are drawn from mutual friends, your networks and contacts you\u2019ve uploaded, among other criteria.  Instagram shares information with Facebook, and it turns out its follow suggestions are just as creepy.  How creepy? I created a fresh Instagram account with my work email and didn\u2019t sync it to Facebook. Still, 78 out of 100 recommendations were my Facebook friends.  The other 22 names were even more interesting. They looked like strangers. But you can get linked to people\u2014even borderline strangers\u2014who saved your email or phone number and synced their contacts to Facebook, which they\u2019ve linked to their Instagram. One of my suggested friends was an apartment broker I\u2019d emailed through Craigslist... in 2009. (Gizmodo actually built a People You May Know Inspector so you can study Facebook\u2019s seemingly mysterious links.)  Even when you don\u2019t upload your contacts directly to Instagram, the network uses information\u2014or \u201csignals,\u201d as Instagram calls them\u2014from Facebook, which might include contacts or other tangential information.  No Mo\u2019 Notifications  Now is not a bad time to go through your notification settings. Did you know that Instagram has 17 categories? Among them are notifications about which Facebook friends use Instagram. If you don\u2019t want to be bugged constantly about adding them, you can turn this off. Just remember: This won\u2019t stop Instagram from telling your Facebook friends that you\u2019re on the app.  You might want to shut off other notifications too, such as the one that says someone is posting for the first time in a while, or my personal favorite, the one that reminds you that you have unseen notifications.  On top of that, Facebook, Instagram and Messenger have been testing a cross-platform notification feature, which lets users see all alerts and hop between the apps.  I understand why Instagram is adopting Facebook features: They work. But for years I logged into Instagram and enjoyed it more than Facebook. I fear a day when I wake up, open my phone and can no longer tell the difference between the two.

FILE PHOTO: Rescue workers attend the scene where a Tesla electric SUV crashed into a barrier on U.S. Highway 101 in Mountain View, California, March 25, 2018. KTVU FOX 2/via REUTERS  Tesla also said vehicle logs from the accident showed no action had been taken by the driver soon before the crash and that he had received earlier warnings to put his hands on the wheel.  \u201cThe driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken,\u201d Tesla said.  The statement did not say why the Autopilot system apparently did not detect the concrete divider.  The fatal crash and vehicle fire of the Tesla near Mountain View, California, involved two other cars and delayed traffic for hours. The 38-year-old Tesla driver died at a nearby hospital shortly after the crash.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which launched an investigation into the crash earlier this week, did not immediately comment late Friday. The National Transportation Safety Board is also investigating the fatal crash.  Autopilot allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods under certain conditions. Tesla requires users to agree to keep their hands on the wheel \u201cat all times\u201d before they can use autopilot, but users routinely tout the fact they can use the system to drive hands-free.  The NTSB faulted Tesla in a prior fatal autopilot crash.  In September, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said operational limitations in the Tesla Model S played a major role in a May 2016 crash that killed a driver using autopilot.  That death \u2014 the first fatality in a Tesla vehicle operating in Autopilot mode \u2014 raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for long stretches with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.  The NTSB said Tesla could have taken further steps to prevent the system\u2019s misuse, and faulted the driver for not paying attention and for \u201coverreliance on vehicle automation.\u201d  In January, NHTSA and NTSB launched investigations into a Tesla vehicle, apparently traveling in semi-autonomous mode, that struck a fire truck in California. Neither agency nor Tesla has offered any update.  The government probes raise the risk for Tesla and automakers at a time when the industry is seeking federal legislation that would ease deployment of self driving cars.  The crash comes soon after an Uber vehicle in Arizona in self-driving mode struck and killed a pedestrian in the first death linked to an autonomous vehicle.  Tesla said late Friday that \u201cAutopilot does not prevent all accidents \u2013 such a standard would be impossible \u2013 but it makes them much less likely to occur. It unequivocally makes the world safer for the vehicle occupants, pedestrians and cyclists.\u201d  Tesla said that in the United States \u201cthere is one automotive fatality every 86 million miles across all vehicles from all manufacturers. For Tesla, there is one fatality, including known pedestrian fatalities, every 320 million miles in vehicles equipped with Autopilot hardware.\u201d  Tesla in September 2016 unveiled improvements to Autopilot, adding new limits on hands-off driving.

The LF-1\u2019s also previews a futuristic navigation technology that anticipates where the driver is going based on driving habits and history, and provides hotel recommendations or other concierge services.

We want to be the brand which is emotionally connected with the customer,\u201d said Cooper Ericksen, vice president of U.S. marketing for Lexus.  The Japanese luxury brands are fighting to gain ground in the U.S. luxury market as Volkswagen AG\u2019s (VOWG_p.DE) Audi brand and Mercedes-Benz have expanded sales, and Tesla has provided a fresh alternative to the established brands.  Last year the Lexus brand suffered a 7.6 percent slide in U.S. sales last year. At Honda Motor Co Ltd\u2019s (7267.T) Acura luxury brand, 2017 sales fell 3.9 percent from 2016. Nissan Motor Co Ltd\u2019s (7201.T) Infiniti pushed up sales by 11.3 percent, mainly by selling almost twice as many sport utility vehicles as cars. However, Infiniti\u2019s total 2017 sales of 153,415 vehicles put it behind the leading Germany luxury car brands, as well as Acura, Lexus and General Motors Co\u2019s (GM.N) Cadillac brand.  Lexus, Infiniti and Acura launched in the U.S. market in the late 1980s and took advantage of quality problems at Audi and a lack of innovation at the then-leading luxury brands in the market, General Motors Co\u2019s (GM.N) Cadillac and Ford Motor Co\u2019s (F.N) Lincoln brand.  Now, the structure of the U.S. luxury vehicle market has changed. Four brands - Daimler AG\u2019s (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz, BMW AG (BMWG.DE), Volkswagen\u2019s Audi brand and Lexus dominate sales in the U.S. luxury market.  Tesla, meanwhile, has gathered more than 400,000 orders for its Model 3 sedan, which is just starting to reach customers as the automaker tries to iron out production problems.  In Detroit, Infiniti showed a future sedan powered by a high efficiency gasoline engine.

The unprecedented pay package has been criticized as too costly by proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co., which has recommended that investors reject the plan.

While the company has struggled to mass-manufacture cars including the new Model 3 sedan, he\u2019s convinced investors to buy into his vision of consumers converting to electric vehicles in droves.  Tesla lists its dependence on Musk as a risk factor in securities filings, and some analysts and short sellers have raised concern that the carmaker could run into trouble because of the amount of attention he devotes to other ventures including rocket company Space Exploration Technologies Corp.  \u201cI expect to remain CEO for the foreseeable future,\u201d Musk said during Tesla\u2019s earnings call in February. \u201cThere are no plans to make a change at this time.\u201d  Tesla without Elon wouldn\u2019t be the same company, said Joel Grant, an automotive and industrial analyst at T.

The National Transportation Safety Board is currently investigating the crash.  Tesla says it willingly withdrew from NTSB investigation  Tesla says it willingly withdrew from the party agreement with the National Transportation Safety Board, adding that the NTSB is more concerned with \u201cpress headlines than actually promoting safety,\u201d a Tesla spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. \u201cLast week, in a conversation with the NTSB, we were told that if we made additional statements before their 12-24 month investigative process is complete, we would no longer be a party to the investigation agreement,\u201d a Tesla spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cOn Tuesday, we chose to withdraw from the agreement and issued a statement to correct misleading claims that had been made about Autopilot \u2014 claims which made it seem as though Autopilot creates safety problems when the opposite is true.\u201d This comes after the NTSB said it revoked Tesla\u2019s party status in the investigation regarding the fatal crash involving one of Tesla\u2019s Model X cars. The NTSB said it did so because Tesla, without permission from the NTSB, relayed information to the public regarding the investigation. Tesla went on to note the prevalence of automotive fatalities in the United States in comparison to fatalities involving cars with Autopilot. Tesla says for every 320 million miles cars equipped with Autopilot drive, there is one fatality, including known pedestrian fatalities. That\u2019s compared to one fatality for every 86 million miles driven for all vehicles, Tesla said. \u201cIf you are driving a Tesla equipped with Autopilot hardware, you are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident and this continues to improve,\u201d the spokesperson said. Tesla also alleges its \u201cclear in our conversations\u201d with the NTSB that it cares less about safety and more about press headlines. \u201cAmong other things, they repeatedly released partial bits of incomplete information to the media in violation of their own rules, at the same time that they were trying to prevent us from telling all the facts,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe this is right and we will be making an official complaint to Congress. We will also be issuing a Freedom Of Information Act request to understand the reasoning behind their focus on the safest cars in America while they ignore the cars that are the least safe. Perhaps there is a sound rationale for this, but we cannot imagine what that could possibly be.\u201d Tesla also took time to note how the NTSB is an advisory body, rather than a regulatory one, and how Tesla has a \u201cstrong and positive relationship\u201d with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) \u201cWhen tested by NHTSA, Model S and Model X each received five stars not only overall but in every sub-category,\u201d the Tesla spokesperson said. \u201cThis was the only time an SUV had ever scored that well. Moreover, of all the cars that NHTSA has ever tested, Model S and Model X scored as the two cars with the lowest probability of injury. There is no company that cares more about safety and the evidence speaks for itself.\u201d When reached for comment pertaining to Tesla\u2019s claims, the NTSB says it stands by the press release it issued earlier and has nothing to add. Meanwhile, the NHTSA says its investigation is ongoing. \u201cThe agency is in contact with local investigators, consistent with NHTSA\u2019s vigilant oversight and authority over the safety of all motor vehicles and equipment,\u201d an NHTSA spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cNHTSA is dispatching its Special Crash Investigation Team and will take action as appropriate.\u201d  Tesla is no longer working with NTSB in fatal Model X crash investigation  In light of Tesla going a bit rogue and disclosing details of the fatal crash that involved Autopilot, the National Transportation Safety Board is removing Tesla as a party in the investigation. \u201cThe NTSB took this action because Tesla violated the party agreement by releasing investigative information before it was vetted and confirmed by the NTSB,\u201d the NTSB wrote in a press release today. \u201cSuch releases of incomplete information often lead to speculation and incorrect assumptions about the probable cause of a crash, which does a disservice to the investigative process and the traveling public.\u201d This is not too surprising, given the NTSB said it was \u201cunhappy\u201d with Tesla following its March 30 disclosure that Autopilot was engaged during the crash. Losing party status means Tesla is no longer able to provide technical assistance to the NTSB. As the NTSB notes, having party status is a \u201cprivilege\u201d that enables two-way information sharing. \u201cIt is unfortunate that Tesla, by its actions, did not abide by the party agreement,\u201d said NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt. \u201cWe decided to revoke Tesla\u2019s party status and informed Mr. Musk in a phone call last evening and via letter today. While we understand the demand for information that parties face during an NTSB investigation, uncoordinated releases of incomplete information do not further transportation safety or serve the public interest.\u201d The NTSB says it\u2019s rare to revoke party status, but that it has happened before. While Tesla is no longer an official party, the NTSB says it expects Tesla to cooperate with any future data requests. While Tesla is no longer a party in this specific case, the company is still working with the NTSB in other investigations, like the one pertaining to a crash in Lake Forest, California and one in Culver City. On Wednesday, Tesla provided Bloomberg with a statement implying Tesla willingly withdrew from the party agreement. \u201cTesla withdrew from the party agreement with the NTSB because it requires that we not release information about Autopilot to the public, a requirement which we believe fundamentally affects public safety negatively,\u201d the company said in a statement to Bloomberg. \u201cWe believe in transparency, so an agreement that prevents public release of information for over a year is unacceptable.\u201d In a lengthy statement, Tesla said it willingly chose to withdraw from the agreement: Last week, in a conversation with the NTSB, we were told that if we made additional statements before their 12-24 month investigative process is complete, we would no longer be a party to the investigation agreement. On Tuesday, we chose to withdraw from the agreement and issued a statement to correct misleading claims that had been made about Autopilot \u2014 claims which made it seem as though Autopilot creates safety problems when the opposite is true. In the US, there is one automotive fatality every 86 million miles across all vehicles. For Tesla, there is one fatality, including known pedestrian fatalities, every 320 million miles in vehicles equipped with Autopilot hardware. If you are driving a Tesla equipped with Autopilot hardware, you are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident and this continues to improve. It\u2019s been clear in our conversations with the NTSB that they\u2019re more concerned with press headlines than actually promoting safety. Among other things, they repeatedly released partial bits of incomplete information to the media in violation of their own rules, at the same time that they were trying to prevent us from telling all the facts. We don\u2019t believe this is right and we will be making an official complaint to Congress. We will also be issuing a Freedom Of Information Act request to understand the reasoning behind their focus on the safest cars in America while they ignore the cars that are the least safe. Perhaps there is a sound rationale for this, but we cannot imagine what that could possibly be. Something the public may not be aware of is that the NTSB is not a regulatory body, it is an advisory body. The regulatory body for the automotive industry in the US is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) with whom we have a strong and positive relationship. After doing a comprehensive study, NHTSA found that even the early version of Tesla Autopilot resulted in 40% fewer crashes. Autopilot has improved substantially since then. When tested by NHTSA, Model S and Model X each received five stars not only overall but in every sub-category. This was the only time an SUV had ever scored that well. Moreover, of all the cars that NHTSA has ever tested, Model S and Model X scored as the two cars with the lowest probability of injury. There is no company that cares more about safety and the evidence speaks for itself.  NTSB is \u2018unhappy\u2019 about Tesla publicly disclosing details of fatal crash  Tesla provided some more details on Friday about the fatal crash involving one of its Model X vehicles, but the National Transportation Safety Board isn\u2019t particularly happy about that, The Washington Post first reported. \u201cIn each of our investigations involving a Tesla vehicle, Tesla has been extremely cooperative on assisting with the vehicle data,\u201d NTSB spokesperson Chris O\u2019Neil told TechCrunch \u201cHowever, the NTSB is unhappy with the release of investigative information by Tesla.\u201d That\u2019s because those involved in an NTSB investigation are required to inform the Board of information releases before doing so. \u201cThe uncoordinated release of investigative information can affect how other parties work with us in the future so we take each unauthorized release seriously,\u201d O\u2019Neil told TechCrunch. \u201cHowever, this release will not hinder our investigation.\u201d Last week, Tesla said Autopilot, the company\u2019s semi-autonomous mode that can change lanes and maintain proper vehicle positions and safe speeds, was engaged in the moments leading up to the crash. \u201cThe driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver\u2019s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision,\u201d Tesla wrote in a blog post. \u201cThe driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken.\u201d While Tesla and the NTSB have made some early observations, there\u2019s still more work to be done as part of the investigation. The NTSB, for example, still needs Tesla\u2019s help to decode the data the vehicle recorded and ultimately determine the \u201cprobable cause\u201d of the crash, NTSB spokesperson O\u2019Neil told the Post. The investigation has also expanded to look into the concerns the driver had previously expressed about Autopilot. Walter Huang, the owner of the car who died as a result of the crash, had previously taken his car into the Tesla dealership, saying his car had a way of veering toward the exact barrier his car hit, ABC7 reported last week. Tesla, however, says it has no record of Huang complaining about Autopilot. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a thorough search of our service records and we cannot find anything suggesting that the customer ever complained to Tesla about the performance of Autopilot,\u201d a Tesla spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cThere was a concern raised once about navigation not working correctly, but Autopilot\u2019s performance is unrelated to navigation.\u201d Tesla declined to comment on the NTSB\u2019s concerns.  Tesla says fatal crash involved Autopilot  Tesla has provided another update to last week\u2019s fatal crash. As it turns out, Tesla said the driver had Autopilot on with the adaptive cruise control follow-distance set to minimum. However, it seems the driver ignored the vehicle\u2019s warnings to take back control. \u201cThe driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver\u2019s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision,\u201d Tesla wrote in a blog post. \u201cThe driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken.\u201d The promise of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system is to reduce car accidents. In the company\u2019s blog post, Tesla notes Autopilot reduces crash rates by 40 percent, according to an independent review by the U.S. government. Of course, that does not mean the technology is perfect in preventing all accidents. As Tesla previously noted, the crash was so severe because the middle divider on the highway had been damaged in an earlier accident. Tesla also cautioned that Autopilot does not prevent all accidents, but it does make them less likely to occur. No one knows about the accidents that didn\u2019t happen, only the ones that did. The consequences of the public not using Autopilot, because of an inaccurate belief that it is less safe, would be extremely severe. There are about 1.25 million automotive deaths worldwide. If the current safety level of a Tesla vehicle were to be applied, it would mean about 900,000 lives saved per year. We expect the safety level of autonomous cars to be 10 times safer than non-autonomous cars. In the past, when we have brought up statistical safety points, we have been criticized for doing so, implying that we lack empathy for the tragedy that just occurred. Nothing could be further from the truth. We care deeply for and feel indebted to those who chose to put their trust in us. However, we must also care about people now and in the future whose lives may be saved if they know that Autopilot improves safety. None of this changes how devastating an event like this is or how much we feel for our customer\u2019s family and friends. We are incredibly sorry for their loss. This development, of course, comes in light of a fatal accident involving one of Uber\u2019s self-driving cars in Tempe, Arizona.  What Tesla knows about the fatal Model X crash  Tesla has shed some more light on the fatal crash and fire involving a Model X car last week. In a blog post tonight, Tesla said it\u2019s not yet clear what happened in the time leading up to the accident. Tesla also said it does not yet know what caused it. Tesla did note that, according to its data, Tesla owners have driven that same stretch of Highway 101 with Autopilot engaged about 85,000 times since Tesla first rolled out the automated control system in 2015. Since the beginning of this year, Tesla drivers have successfully handled that stretch of the highway 20,000 times, according to Tesla. \u201cThe reason this crash was so severe is that the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier which is designed to reduce the impact into a concrete lane divider, had either been removed or crushed in a prior accident without being replaced,\u201d the company wrote. Below, you can see what the barrier was supposed to look like versus what it looked like the day before the accident. Tesla says it obtained the image of the more recent photo from the dash cam of a witness who regularly makes the commute. The company went on to say it has \u201cnever seen this level of damage to a Model X in any other crash.\u201d As previously reported, the accident also caused a fire. In the event there is a fire, Tesla says its battery packs are designed so that people have enough time to get out of the car. \u201cAccording to witnesses, that appears to be what happened here as we understand there were no occupants still in the Model X by the time the fire could have presented a risk,\u201d Tesla wrote. \u201cSerious crashes like this can result in fire regardless of the type of car, and Tesla\u2019s billions of miles of actual driving data shows that a gas car in the United States is five times more likely to experience a fire than a Tesla vehicle.\u201d The promise of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system is to reduce car accidents. In the company\u2019s blog post, Tesla notes Autopilot reduces crash rates by 40 percent, according to an independent review by the U.S. government. Of course, that does not mean the technology is perfect in preventing all accidents.

In addition, the company has set a dozen revenue and adjusted profit goals. Mr. Musk would receive 1.68 million shares, or about 1 percent of the company, only after he reaches milestones for both.  But to put these numbers in perspective, Tesla is worth only about $59 billion today.  If Mr. Musk were somehow to increase the value of Tesla to $650 billion \u2014 a figure many experts would contend is laughably impossible and would make Tesla one of the five largest companies in the United States, based on current valuations \u2014 his stock award could be worth as much as $55 billion (assuming the company does not issue any more shares over the next decade, which is unrealistic). Even reaching several of the milestones would bring him billions.  Mr. Musk\u2019s critics \u2014 and there are many \u2014 are likely to contend that the new compensation plan is just the company\u2019s latest publicity stunt. He has been called a modern-day P.T. Barnum who has created the illusion of success while consistently missing production estimates. The company continues to lose money; at one point last year, it was losing almost a half-million dollars an hour, according to Bloomberg News. Jim Chanos, a short-seller who has bet against Tesla\u2019s shares \u2014 and has thus far been on the losing side of that trade \u2014 has contended that Tesla is worthless.  But Mr. Musk\u2019s compensation plan is no illusion: He gets paid only if the company succeeds over the long term with significant gains in market cap. And it\u2019s impossible for him to manipulate the system by trying to prop up the stock price for a temporary period. Under the terms of the arrangement, even once his shares vest, he has to hold them an additional five years before he is allowed to sell them.  The way the arrangement is structured, each milestone is a blunt instrument: He either reaches it or gets nothing.  \u201cIf all that happens over the next 10 years is that Tesla\u2019s value grows by 80 or 90 percent, then my amount of compensation would be zero,\u201d he said. (His calculations were based on the stock price at the beginning of this year when the company was worth about $50 billion.)  Still, he contended, \u201cI actually see the potential for Tesla to become a trillion-dollar company within a 10-year period.\u201d  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Many other companies have installed outsize packages that often come at the expense of shareholders because the executives get paid even when they underperform their peers.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Asked how he thinks shareholders should feel about Mr. Musk\u2019s new pay package, Ira Ehrenpreis, chairman of Tesla\u2019s compensation committee, told me, \u201cIt\u2019s heads you win, tails you don\u2019t lose,\u201d meaning if Mr. Musk is gaining billions then shareholders are winning, too. And if Mr. Musk does not perform, shareholders pay nothing.  Mr. Musk\u2019s new compensation plan is similar to the previous one put in place when the company was worth $3.2 billion in 2012. Only now, the numbers are much larger. That package also paid Mr. Musk only when he reached certain market value and operational benchmarks. And virtually nobody could imagine Tesla would be worth 17 times what it was back then.  Mr. Musk has reached all but one of the metrics in that plan.  Even though Mr. Musk\u2019s shares have vested, he has not sold them except to pay the taxes on the grants. His current stake is worth $13 billion.  Mr. Musk does not take a salary, although under California State law, Tesla is required to pay him at least minimum wage. Tesla sends him checks that pay him a little more than $37,000 annually. \u201cI don\u2019t cash it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just ends up accumulating in a Tesla bank account somewhere.\u201d  To afford to live, Mr. Musk has borrowed against his shares, a practice that some corporate executives have questioned. Mr. Musk insists that the loans are such a small portion of his stake in the company that even if Tesla shares were to fall precipitously, it would not impact him or the company.  If Mr. Musk succeeds in hitting some of his benchmarks, it would also mean that the company\u2019s employees, including those who work on the factory floor, who get paid in both cash and stock, could become wealthy.  Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, Mr. Musk has to remain the company\u2019s chief executive, though the agreement would allow him to become chief product officer and executive chairman with a chief executive reporting to him. He said he saw that as a possibility only if the company became so large that he needed to recruit a top person to oversee the operations.  Mr. Musk has often said he is not driven by money. So what is it about this incentive plan that appeals to him?  \u201cNone of it is intended for dynastic wealth creation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason that it\u2019s important to me personally is that there\u2019s some pretty big things that I want to do.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cI want to contribute as much as possible to humanity becoming a multi-planet species,\u201d he said, alluding to a goal he has talked about often, including having people live on Mars. \u201cThat obviously requires a certain amount of capital.\u201d", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/business/dealbook/tesla-elon-musk-pay.html"}, {"article": "Although valued similarly, there are vast differences between the companies.

If it gets those things right, all the other issues will sort themselves out. Tesla has already defied skeptics and attracted legions of die-hard fans by surmounting seemingly impossible odds to build all-electric cars that have drawn lavish praise from automotive critics.  That includes the Model 3, which Popular Mechanics named its 2018 Car of the Year. (It was a finalist for Motor Trend\u2019s similar award. That it lost out to the Alfa Romeo Giulia has drawn howls of online protest.)  When my Model 3 test vehicle pulled up to the curb on Eighth Avenue, it didn\u2019t quite stop pedestrian traffic the way opening the gull-wing doors on the Model X had, but I could see why the automotive press is so excited. The interior features a single slab of wood sweeping around the cockpit interrupted only by a touch-screen interface that houses nearly all the controls, many of them voice activated.  With its Zen minimalism, it doesn\u2019t look or feel like any other car I\u2019ve been in. The synthetic-leather seats are comfortable, and there\u2019s ample room for someone my size (6-foot-3). This all comes at a cost: $57,500 for this luxurious long-range version, far from the $35,000 base price that has excited many potential Tesla buyers.  The Model 3 may not have the rocketlike acceleration of the X, but I found it nimble and responsive. I easily accelerated from a full stop into traffic flowing at highway speed, usually a nerve-racking maneuver in a conventional car. Driving the Model 3 was such a pleasure I was reluctant to cede any control to Autopilot.  For someone with decades of experience driving a conventional car, my first taste of semiautonomous driving last fall had come as a shock. The sensation of a vehicle moving on its own was so bizarre that I instinctively gripped the steering wheel, which immediately transferred control back to me.  This time I was more relaxed, willing to see how the car would behave. I gave the voice-activated navigation system a destination (Garden State Plaza, a New Jersey shopping mall about 20 miles away), and the car accelerated, braked, stayed in the center of the lane and maintained a comfortable three-car distance ahead of me, all without my intervention. At the mall, it detected an empty parking place, and flawlessly backed into it.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  One of its most impressive features is the ability for the driver to change lanes simply by pressing the turn-signal lever. The Tesla scans for traffic in the adjacent lane, waits for an opening and then glides into place, eliminating the danger of a blind spot.

Although I\u2019d been briefed on its limitations, so successful was Autopilot that I was tempted to let down my guard by not bothering to look in the rearview mirror. That would have been a mistake.  For all its vision capabilities (including in darkness), Autopilot became confused when lanes weren\u2019t clearly marked or split in two or at exit ramps. You can\u2019t simply program the destination and let the car find its way. It\u2019s reassuringly cautious about changing lanes, but in heavy traffic, I would have missed an exit while waiting for it to find a suitable opening, and had to assert manual control.  While heading south on the New Jersey Turnpike, I could see in the rearview mirror a BMW bearing down at high speed. I pushed the turn signal for a lane change, and despite its ultrasonic sensors, the Tesla seemed oblivious to the onrushing car. It started to move into its lane; the driver laid on his horn, and I had to grab control to avoid an accident.  Blog posts indicate that other drivers have experienced the same issue.  The Tesla owner\u2019s manual describes this situation as one that the system can\u2019t yet manage. Tesla said it expected future upgrades to solve the problem, but for now, drivers need to be as attentive to the rearview mirror as with any other car.  Tesla had no comment for this column.  At this juncture, Autopilot is a misnomer, as many others have observed. \u201cThis is not self-driving technology,\u201d said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist and expert on autonomous vehicle technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a collaborative system that leaves responsibility for safety in the drivers\u2019 hands and isn\u2019t intended to let them sit in the back seat or pursue other activities while driving.\u201d Even though some companies have said they plan driverless ride services in as little as two years, Mr. Reimer said full automation was likely to be many years or even decades in the future.  Self-driving automation systems are ranked from zero (no automation) to 5 (full automation). Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is Level 2. It requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the wheel. The car issues a prompt if it doesn\u2019t detect a hand on the wheel, and Autopilot shuts down if there\u2019s no response. In the Mountain View accident, Tesla has said, the driver \u201creceived several visual and one audible hands-on warning,\u201d but \u201cthe driver\u2019s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.\u201d  Given that this was my first extended drive using Autopilot, I was hypervigilant, maybe even more so than in a conventional car. I\u2019m told that wears off in time, as using Autopilot becomes second nature. The risk is that complacency contributes to driver inattention. Mr. Reimer and other experts are conducting research into the issue.  \u201cAs technology supplants human performance,\u201d Mr. Reimer said, \u201cthe bigger question is how safe is safe enough. If lane-changing technology is 50 percent more effective than humans, is that good enough? That\u2019s the big question no one wants to answer.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  At the same time, he said, he worries that \u201cintense media coverage of accidents like Mountain View will scare people off.\u201d He said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from that fatality, but noted that Tesla\u2019s excellent safety record over the many millions of miles its cars have now traveled suggested that using Autopilot \u201ccan\u2019t be substantially more risky than conventional controls.\u201d (There were more than 40,000 traffic fatalities in the United States last year.)  After investigating a fatal 2016 crash involving a Tesla S and a tractor-trailer in Florida, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration found no flaws in the Autopilot system. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that Autopilot had performed as intended, but that the driver had become overly reliant on the technology.  After my drive in the Model 3, my sense is that even with its flaws, Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is a vast improvement over conventional controls, and enhances (rather than supplants) the driving experience. I\u2019m tempted to join the Model 3 waiting list, which numbers over 400,000 customers.  Investors, too, seem to have reassessed Tesla\u2019s recent bad news. This past week, Tesla said it had succeeded in ramping up production of the Model 3, though it still fell short of targets, and had adequate capital for the rest of the year.

Chief Executive Elon Musk once had predicted reaching a rate of production of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles a week by the end of the last year\u2019s fourth quarter\u2014a prediction that had already fallen from 20,000 in December and, at one point, as many as 200,000 in the second half of 2017. Tesla ended up making 2,425 Model 3s in the fourth quarter, the company reported in January as it pushed back the goal of reaching 5,000 a week until the end of June.  CASH BURN: Mr. Musk has long said the ramp-up of the Model 3, a sedan with a $35,000 price tag aimed at making Tesla vehicles more accessible, would generate the cash needed to fund the company\u2019s expansion. The sedan\u2019s delays put that vision at risk. Tesla began the final three months of 2017 with $3.5 billion on hand and planned to spend $1 billion during the period on capital expenditures. Earlier this month, the company raised about $550 million from bonds. Tesla executives have said they need a minimum of $1 billion each quarter for working capital. Colin Langan, an analyst for UBS, estimates Tesla can generate about $1 billion in working capital once it produces 5,000 Model 3s a week. Even so, he and others expect Tesla will need to raise additional money.  WHAT\u2019S NEXT: In recent months, Mr. Musk has generated attention talking about plans for new vehicles\u2014a two-door Roadster sports car, commercial truck and compact SUV\u2014as well as new factories in Europe and China. All would cost billions of dollars. In November, he and Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja hinted at internal discussions about whether Tesla needed to back away from some of its growth plans to rein in spending. Investors are anxious for clarity about the evolving strategy. Excitement over the new products may already be helping Mr. Musk\u2019s cash situation. Deposits in the fourth quarter for the new commercial truck and the sports car, as well as a sell-down in Model S and Model X inventory, may have boosted Tesla\u2019s working capital by $700 million, according to Mr. Langan\u2019s estimates.

Residential solar had been on a tear, averaging 49% annual growth between 2010 and 2016, but the number of megawatts added last year dropped by 16% compared with the year before, according to new data from GTM Research, a firm that tracks renewable energy. It was the first annual decline since at least 2000, which is as far back as GTM tracks figures.  Industry executives and energy experts said the slowdown was driven by a sharp retreat by national solar installers, including Tesla\u2019s SolarCity and Vivint Solar Inc. VSLR -2.44% Those big outfits had deployed large sales forces to pitch homeowners on the benefits of rooftop solar, and heavily marketed deals to lease panels that required little to no money down.  The race to build a dominant national solar brand led companies to burn through cash. Unable to maintain that pace, companies scaled back and focused on profits over growth, or in some cases, got out of the rooftop solar business altogether.  SolarCity, purchased by Tesla in 2016, posted the largest declines. Once the clear-cut leader among solar installers, with one-third of the national market two years ago, it ended door-to-door sales last year and cut customer-acquisition spending. Its sales, as measured by megawatts deployed, fell by 38% in 2017, according to company figures, which include both residential and commercial installations.  Tesla said it was moving away from no-money-down leases and toward sales. It appears to have been passed by rival Sunrun Inc. RUN 0.35% in recent months as the top solar installer in the country, according to GTM.  \u201cWe expect growth to resume later this year,\u201d Tesla said last month.  Other companies also retreated from heavily marketing their home solar businesses, including NRG Energy Inc., NRG 0.37% which shut its business last year, and Vivint, which posted a 17% drop in residential sales volume in 2017 as it moved to prioritize profitability. Sungevity Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection last year after an aggressive growth strategy resulted in too much debt, the company said in a court filing.  The industry\u2019s sales strategies have attracted scrutiny by regulators in some states, including New Mexico, where the state attorney general, Hector Balderas, filed a lawsuit last month claiming that Vivint used \u201cfalse, misleading and fraudulent statements\u201d to sign customers up for long-term deals.  Rob Kain, Vivint\u2019s vice president of investor relations, said the company disagrees with the allegations and plans to contest them in court.  \u201cCould we have had a salesperson who was aggressive? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised,\u201d Mr. Kain said, adding that the company would have fired a salesperson for misrepresentations.  SolarCity grew with help from a hard-charging sales culture. Before being acquired by Tesla, the company, which was run by Lyndon Rive, the cousin of Tesla founder Elon Musk, tapped salespeople from the mortgage industry and Las Vegas casinos to sell solar panels, and gave them aggressive quotas, according to current and former managers and employees interviewed by The Wall Street Journal.  Last year, Tesla changed course and began selling solar panels through the same stores that sell its cars. Other sales approaches were shut down in order to \u201cfocus on projects with better margins,\u201d the company said.  Eric White, president and chief executive of Dividend Finance , a San Francisco-based company that provides loans to homeowners putting solar on their roofs, said many solar companies acted too much like Silicon Valley firms, pursuing growth at all costs in hopes of becoming leaders in a nascent market.  Mr. White said that while the industry\u2019s prior growth is \u201cnot sustainable and leaves bodies in its tracks,\u201d 5%-to-15% annual increases are achievable.  Solar energy grew rapidly in recent years as the cost of solar panels declined. The all-in cost of a typical rooftop solar system fell by 61% between 2010 and 2017 to $2.80 per watt, or roughly $16,000 for the average home system, according to the federal government.  Solar executives and industry analysts believe annual residential solar growth will resume in 2018. But two developments risk hurting sales in coming years, say industry analysts. First, new Trump administration tariffs on imported solar modules, mostly from China, are expected to marginally raise costs. Second, a federal government tax incentive to homeowners worth 30% of the value of the solar array is set to end by 2021.  Lynn Jurich, chief executive of Sunrun, said rising utility electricity rates and falling solar panel costs will drive increased interest in solar.  \u201cWe saw an unnaturally high growth rate because there was a lot of capital coming in to spend on advertising and customer origination, and not a lot of discipline on focusing on profitable growth,\u201d she said of the sector as a whole. \u201cYou suck all the advertising out of an industry and it shrinks.\u201d  Still, companies continue to spend considerable amounts acquiring customers. Sunrun estimates it spends about 28 cents on marketing for every dollar spent on purchasing and installing panels.  Sophie Karp, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, said industrywide customer-acquisition costs were higher.  \u201cSolar is not a product that you buy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a product that gets sold.\u201d  \u2014Kirsten Grind contributed to this article.

Future cooperation could extend beyond France. A source familiar with the talks said on Tuesday that Amazon and Casino were negotiating a deal in Brazil either partnering or selling Casino\u2019s local appliance and electronics chain Via Varejo SA (VVAR3.SA).  Casino said the process of selling Via Varejo was continuing in Brazil with no new element to report and there was no partnership.  The French move, which is set to shake up the competitive local food retail market, lifted Casino shares as much as 9.7 percent in morning trade amid speculation that it could lead to a bigger deal later on.  Amazon\u2019s purchase of the bricks-and-mortar retailer Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion last year, and a deal for Amazon Prime to sell products from the British supermarket chain Morrisons (MRW.L), raised expectations that it would bid for a retailer or form a partnership in France.  Casino and Amazon said late on Monday that groceries sourced from Monoprix would be available in the Amazon Prime Now app and website through a dedicated virtual store.  The deal is limited to the lucrative Paris market and its suburbs, though Monoprix CEO Regis Schultz told a conference call that an extension to other parts of France could not be ruled out.

It has a strong focus on quality and fresh products in the mould of Whole Foods, and is a key contributor to Casino group profit.  \u201cWe consider the Monoprix product selection as exceptional,\u201d Amazon France CEO Frederic Duval said during the call.  Financial terms were not disclosed, but Schultz said a model where Monoprix does the picking of the order in store and Amazon takes care of delivery was a \u201cprofitable\u201d one for Monoprix.  Slideshow (5 Images)  COMPLEMENTS OCADO DEAL  Casino already has a delivery partnership with UK online retailer Ocado (OCDO.L), signed last year.  The two deals were complementary as the Ocado technology will allow Monoprix to address the needs of its traditional clients with a bigger basket and seeking next-day delivery. Clients of Amazon Prime, set up in Paris in 2016, are looking for fewer items and want express delivery.  Since the purchase of Whole Foods Market, expectations that Amazon could focus next on Europe have spurred French retailers to try to improve their own online offerings.  Carrefour (CARR.PA) announced in January that it would invest 2.8 billion euros in digital commerce over the next five years, six times its current investment.

And their parents. And most of their grandparents.  But one group of potential customers has eluded the world\u2019s biggest Internet retailer.  Teenagers, otherwise known as Generation Z, with their lack of debit and credit cards, their absence of bank accounts and their overwhelming preference for actually putting on clothes and going to physical stores to buy things they could purchase online, pose a big challenge to Amazon.  Amazon\u2019s answer: The internet behemoth is in early discussions with banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Capital One Financial Corp. to create a product similar to checking accounts, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity. Amazon aims to tailor the accounts to appeal especially to youngsters and those who own no plastic in their wallets, the people said.  Debit Devotees Consumers between the ages of 18-24 prefer debit cards to other forms of payments Source: Total System Services Inc.  \u201cThe sooner you can start collecting information on them, the better prepared you are,\u201d said Tim Barefield, a managing director at the consulting firm Kotter International. \u201cFor Amazon, it\u2019s another way to expand their brand. Their brand is reaching out every place that their tentacles can reach out to.\u201d  The move shows Amazon\u2019s recognition that digital accounts for minors potentially lock in lifetime customers before they even leave their parents\u2019 house. Amazon is savvy about its users\u2019 life cycles. It offers new parents discounts on diapers and baby food. It gives college students discounted Amazon Prime memberships, providing free shipping and access to streaming video so young adults will already be Amazon shoppers when they start making more of their own spending decisions.  Pseudo Card  Since many young people don\u2019t qualify for credit cards, Amazon created a pseudo-debit card called Amazon Cash that lets teenagers drop off money at drugstores such as 7-Eleven Inc. and CVS Health Corp. and add it to an Amazon wallet they can use online.  But Amazon has long known the process is clunky and has wanted to take steps to make it easier for customers without bank accounts to shop on its website. Walmart Inc. and American Express Co. offer accounts called Bluebird that have made inroads with teens.  Amazon, led by billionaire Jeff Bezos, is trying to stay on top even as it had revenue of $178 billion last year, a 31 percent jump from 2016 and an almost 2,500 percent increase from 2004, when many of these potential new customers were born.  Service Charges  Children under the age of 18 typically aren\u2019t able to sign up for a bank account without parental consent. Checking accounts for high school students often come with monthly service charges and overdraft fees.  So there\u2019s a chance for Amazon to improve the banking experience, said Stuart Sopp, chief executive officer of Current, a startup that offers debit cards to teens.  \u201cI\u2019m sure Amazon is scaring the hell out of every single regional bank and credit union right now,\u201d Sopp said. \u201cThe banks have very clearly not serviced these demographics, so there\u2019s opportunity.\u201d  Check Yes Consumers said they were open to banking with Amazon, even if it came with a fee Source: Cornerstone Advisors, StrategyCorps  If Amazon could deliver a better banking experience for digitally savvy youngsters who are used to getting what they want with a few swipes or clicks, they might have banking customers for a long time, said Eric Marks, a senior director at the financial consultancy West Monroe Partners.  Amazon might also entice teens with its personal assistant Alexa. Such devices are popular among teens looking for a convenient way to pay, said Gavin Rosenberg, a senior director at the payments processor Total System Services Inc.  \u201cThe younger generations are less concerned about privacy, so they\u2019re more apt to use them,\u201d Rosenberg said.  Adults, Too  The marketing opportunity doesn\u2019t end with teenagers. The e-commerce giant could also end up persuading people to close their existing bank accounts and open a new one with Amazon, according to a Cornerstone Advisors study published in January. It would also be a chance for a bank to partner with the online gargantuan.  \u201cRight now, banks might not be offering exactly what millennials want or need,\u201d said Marielle Schurig, a financial adviser at UBS Group AG who works with high-net-worth millennials. \u201cA lot of monthly statements don\u2019t offer insights or tools to manage your records or analyze your spending to budget or save for the future\u201d -- something Amazon might provide.

Amazon.com Inc. is a convenient scapegoat for just about any issue. The mail is no different.  Amazon isn\u2019t killing the post office. Since signing a landmark contract in 2013 to expand their business relationship and deliver packages on Sunday, revenue has ticked up; losses are down; and shipping is just about the only growth segment in the mailbag. The Postal Service is saddled by larger issues. Sure, there\u2019s the internet, and nobody is sending postcards anymore, but the big financial dilemma is the agency\u2019s yearly obligation to set aside cash to cover health care costs for future retirees. This accounts for billions in losses.  Give Up? U.S. Postal Service makes small improvements but is nowhere close to sustainable Source: U.S. Postal Service  U.S. mail is also required to cover every American, employing carriers who roam neighborhoods six days a week (or seven, if Amazon has a package ready). The Postal Service has said it actually makes money on the Amazon deal. E-commerce revenue provides \u201cessential support to pay for the network and infrastructure that enables us to fulfill our universal service obligation,\u201d David Partenheimer, a spokesman for the Postal Service, wrote in a January op-ed. \u201cAll users of the mail benefit.\u201d  The Amazonification of U.S. Mail Shipping revenue overtook junk mail for the first time last year Source: U.S. Postal Service  Amazon rebuilt its delivery network around the post several years ago. The company operates \u201c sortation centers\u201d that complement warehouses and organize packages by zip code before sending them to post offices for the final leg of delivery. In Kenosha, Wisconsin, Amazon has a million-square-foot warehouse, connected to a 500,000-square-foot sort center with a covered conveyor belt that resembles an airport skybridge.  Ending the U.S. mail relationship would probably be a bigger setback for Amazon than for the Postal Service. On a dark day in late 2011 when the postmaster general proposed cutting 100,000 staff and shutting thousands of post offices, EBay Inc. shares dropped more than 6 percent. Amazon\u2019s deal came soon after, and radical cuts were avoided\u2014probably not a coincidence.  So the e-commerce giant got the Postal Service off life support, but any benefit beyond that is minimal. Nothing short of a complete overhaul of the mail system, some kind of bankruptcy-style financial restructuring or reneging on those health-care promises would turn the Postal Service into a sustainable business.  Maybe that\u2019s Trump\u2019s goal. Building an antitrust case against Amazon\u2014an idea the President has floated\u2014is a tall order. Amazon\u2019s five-year contract with the Postal Service could be up for renewal this year.

From 2013 to 2016, the USPS averaged a net loss of $5.3 billion per year. The reasons behind those losses, though, are more complicated than the way Trump seems to see it. According to the president, the financial woes of the Postal Service have much to do with the deal it has with Amazon.com to deliver the internet retailer\u2019s packages.  Leaving aside Trump\u2019s claims about the Postal Service\u2019s deal with Amazon (which is not a money loser) and his probable reasons for treating it like a pi\u00f1ata (he\u2019s no fan of Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, who also happens to be the owner of the Washington Post, a leading chronicler of this administration\u2019s foibles) the president is right to be concerned with the state of the USPS. The question is whether Trump actually wants to fix the agency or simply tweet about it. If he wants to fix it, there are a number of things he could do.  For starters, he could support a group of U.S. senators with a set of postal reform proposals that could return the agency to solvency. In late March, Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), introduced a bill with a bipartisan co-sponsorship that would move retired postal workers into Medicare, eliminating the agency\u2019s unfunded health-care liabilities and its need to set aside huge sums to cover them. Naturally, some congressional deficit hawks have complained that this would just shift these costs from one side of the federal ledger to the other. Yet the USPS, the second-largest contributor to Medicare after the federal government, has said such a plan would only raise the government\u2019s annual Medicare costs by a 10th of 1 percent.  Ten Years of Losses Net loss, U.S. Postal Service Data: USPS; graphic by Bloomberg Businessweek  The Senate bill, introduced March 22, would also restore half of the 4.3 percent emergency rate increase on items like first-class mail that the Postal Regulatory Commission granted the agency in 2013 only to revoke it three years later. It didn\u2019t matter that first-class mail continued its inexorable decline as more people used email and pay their bills online. The result was a decline in American stamp prices, already among the lowest in the developed world, from 49 cents to 47 cents, which only added to the losses at the USPS.  These are worthy ideas, endorsed with rare unanimity by USPS management, postal worker unions, and many of the institution\u2019s largest customers. Without White House support, however, the Senate bill is likely to wither and die, a fate suffered by other promising reform proposals in recent years. The tragedy isn\u2019t that Trump has yet to express any interest in pushing such ideas, it\u2019s that he appears not to understand how the agency actually functions.  As reported by Bloomberg News, Trump expressed a desire to aides last summer to raise the Postal Service\u2019s rates for delivering Amazon packages. According to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity, Trump\u2019s staff explained to him that the Postal Service is an independent organization and its mail rates are set by a commission.  American presidents have a history of getting involved in matters postal, usually for the better. In 1792, George Washington signed the country\u2019s first postal act, which included lower rates for newspapers in an effort to create an informed citizenry. It was so effective that French political philosopher Alexis De Tocqueville praised the American postal system as \u201cthe great link between minds\u201d when he visited the country in 1831. Trump\u2019s idol Andrew Jackson was so enamored with the Postal Service that he moved it into the president\u2019s cabinet after he was elected in 1828 and stuffed it with his political supporters, a practice that continued for more than a century.  Montgomery Blair, Abraham Lincoln\u2019s postmaster general, introduced free home delivery in cities at a time when most people had to endure long lines at the post office to get their letters. Under Woodrow Wilson, the Postal Service introduced airmail in 1918, clearing the runway for the commercial aviation industry. Richard Nixon signed a bill in 1970 removing the USPS from the president\u2019s cabinet in an effort to remove it from the political hurly-burly and give it the nimbleness of a private company. Unfortunately, it was still subject to heavy-handed congressional and regulatory oversight and often struggled to break even.  In 2006, President George W. Bush signed a bill giving the USPS long overdue power to negotiate package shipping deals like the Amazon one. Unfortunately, the bill required the USPS to set aside $5 billion a year to prefund the health benefits of its future retirees. It wasn\u2019t long before the Great Recession arrived, causing mail volume to plummet.  Decline in Volume of All Mail Number of pieces Data: USPS; graphic by Bloomberg Businessweek  The financial burdens that the Bush administration imposed were clearly untenable. Yet Bush\u2019s successor Barack Obama did virtually nothing to alleviate the situation. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama quipped, \u201cUPS and FedEx are doing fine. It\u2019s the post office that\u2019s always having problems.\u201d Postal workers understandably took issue with his remark. Once Obama was in the White House, his administration quietly supported the USPS\u2019s plan to end Saturday delivery, which would have saved $2 billion a year. It died in Congress because it was vociferously opposed by postal workers unions and congressional representatives from rural areas who said their constituents depended on traditional mail delivery. Meanwhile, the USPS\u2019s losses mounted, and it was forced to cut hours at rural post offices and slow first-class mail delivery in a vain attempt to make ends meet.  Presidents no longer have the control over the Postal Service that they did in Jackson or Wilson\u2019s day. Today, they get to appoint its board of governors. That\u2019s about it for their formal powers, but they can use the bully pulpit to push for change. That\u2019s what Trump is attempting to do now on Twitter in his criticisms of Amazon and the USPS. The problem is that he\u2019s focused on the wrong issues. He returned to Twitter on April 2, recycling an argument made last year by Citigroup analysts who argued that, properly accounted for, the USPS was losing an average of $1.50 on every Amazon package.  It\u2019s a complicated, legalistic case based on the presumption that the USPS, which declines to disclose the agreement\u2019s terms, is essentially providing Amazon a free ride on its letter delivery network rather than requiring it to pay the full costs of the service. That notion excites people at UPS and FedEx and their investors, but few others seem to take it seriously. (The conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page, a frequent critic of the USPS, shrugged it off on Tuesday.)  The reality is that the USPS needs more customers like Amazon, not fewer. It\u2019s required by law to visit every address in the country six days a week regardless of how many bills, greeting cards, and catalogs its letter carriers lug in their sacks. With first-class mail and the junkier kind disappearing, the USPS needs something else to put through the network to make money. Postal workers have a saying: \u201cThe internet giveth, and the internet taketh away,\u201d which is to say the agency\u2019s future lies in online shopping. Amazon is the first retailer to integrate its distribution system into the Postal Service\u2019s network, constructing sorting centers around the country to funnel packages to local post offices so letter carriers can tote them to people\u2019s doors. As e-commerce continues to account for more of what Americans spend, it provides a potential path to a healthier financial future for the USPS.  This vision of the agency\u2019s future is something a shrewd president might champion, but it would require Trump to stop making dubious claims about the reasons for the Postal Service\u2019s financial difficulties. He might even admit that he\u2019s been wrong about the Amazon deal. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not Trump\u2019s style.

The company's cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, grew rapidly and again provided the bulk of Amazon's profits.  Investors cheered the results, sending the company's stock up 6% in after-hours trading.  Amazon's stock jumped more than 6% after the e-commerce giant topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter expectations.  The company reported its holiday-period results on Thursday afternoon. At the time of writing, Amazon's stock was up $85.00 a share, or 6.1%, to $1,475.00.  Here's what the company reported, compared with what analysts polled by Bloomberg had forecast:  Revenue: $60.5 billion; analysts were expecting $59.85 billion.  $60.5 billion; analysts were expecting $59.85 billion.

Without that benefit, the company would have earned $2.15 a share, beating estimates regardless.  Amazon also shared its guidance for the first quarter of 2018:  Revenue (Q1 projected): Between $47.75 billion and $50.75 billion; Wall Street had projected $48.7 billion. Amazon posted $35.7 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2017.  Between $47.75 billion and $50.75 billion; Wall Street had projected $48.7 billion. Amazon posted $35.7 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2017. Operating income (Q1 projected): Between $300 million and $1 billion. Amazon posted $1 billion in operating income in the first quarter last year.  The company's results showed once again the strength of AWS \u2014 and its importance to Amazon's bottom line. Revenue from the company's cloud business grew 45% in the fourth quarter from the same period a year earlier.  Meanwhile, AWS's operating income grew by 46%, to $1.4 billion. That means AWS accounted for 73% of the net income Amazon posted for the period.  Amazon gave only scant details about Whole Foods, the grocery chain it bought last year. The internet company's physical stores, which are largely its Whole Foods outlets, collectively brought in $4.5 billion in sales in the holiday quarter.  By comparison, Whole Foods as a standalone company brought in $4.9 billion in sales in its fiscal first quarter of 2017, approximately the same period a year earlier. But the sales results were actually ahead of Amazon's forecasts, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said on a conference call with investors.  For the quarter, Whole Foods posted a small operational loss, thanks to some non-cash charges, Olsavsky said. Whole Foods earned $95 million in its comparable quarter a year earlier.  Amazon is focusing on cutting prices at the grocery chain, even beyond those it rolled out immediately after taking control of Whole Foods last August, Olsavsky said. But its integration of Whole Foods is continuing apace, he suggested.  The company has already placed some of its automated lockers \u2014 which customers can use to pick up products or return products they've ordered online \u2014 in Whole Foods stores. It plans to list Whole Foods products on the Amazon website and to introduce a customer rewards program, Olsavsky said.  \"Well have more later in the year,\" he said. He continued: \"There's much more to come.\"  Some analysts and investors were skeptical about Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods and have been wondering how far along the company is in integrating Whole Foods into the rest of its operations.

He reportedly feels that Amazon is not paying its fair share of taxes, and has previously claimed that The Washington Post is being used to cover up Amazon's supposed evasion, as Jeff Bezos runs Amazon and owns the newspaper. President Trump is also unhappy with how he believes Amazon is hurting the retail industry, and brick-and-mortar retailers in particular.  President Trump does not currently have a specific plan to attack Amazon, and one may never comes to pass, but there are several ways he could go about it.  Antitrust regulation: Amazon captures a huge percentage of US e-commerce sales and e-commerce growth, without showing signs of slowing down, which has led many to consider the case that it is a monopoly that should be broken up. Such a case would not be close to a slam dunk, as it's unclear if Amazon is a threat to competition or considered to be one under antitrust laws. But if it was successful, the resulting regulations would alter Amazon significantly.

President Trump could lead the charge on finding ways to increase Amazon's federal tax bill in order to take a bigger piece of its revenue and hinder the company. Sales taxes:Amazon collects sales tax in jurisdictions where it is required to, but online sales tax laws vary from state-to-state and city-to-city, and this complexity leads to Amazon not having to collect taxes in certain places. Additionally, in many states, Amazon does not collect taxes for sales from its third-party vendors, leaving it up to them. However, many of these merchants are unclear of their responsibilities, and therefore hesitate to charge sales tax. Although some states are looking into the missing taxes, others have yet to make an effort to solve the problem; until every affected state starts cracking down, Amazon's marketplace will continue to have a price advantage over competitors. If President Trump were to make a push for tougher online sales taxes nationwide, it could give him his desired result of a weakened Amazon.  Meanwhile, the company is still selecting the location for its second headquarters, and has fielded bids that could further shield it from taxes. Amazon has received a number of bids that feature tax breaks, the ability to keep its employees' income taxes, and likely much more, all of which would make it easier for Amazon to pay less in taxes. While these deals would be valuable to Amazon, the potentially extreme level of tax immunity they provide may lead to public backlash, which could bring on new regulations and laws that would hurt the company.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-president-trump-could-go-after-amazon-2018-3"}, {"article": "BI Intelligence  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence \"E-Commerce Briefing\" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Amazon has been hiring house cleaners because it's testing a new housekeeping service, dubbed Amazon Home Assistants, in its home city of Seattle, Bloomberg reports.  Amazon Home Assistants' workers can help customers with tasks like cleaning, laundry, and more, and the service has been generally well reviewed by customers so far.  Hiring its own employees and creating its own unique service is a new approach for Amazon in the housekeeping space.  Amazon launched Amazon Home Services in 2015, which is a marketplace where independent contractors can offer their services under the Amazon Home Services name. The program now offers services like help with home improvement, technology installations, and house cleaning. Despite the service's expansion to all 50 states, and Amazon's claim in 2016 that the market for home services was worth somewhere between $400 billion and $800 billion, Amazon Home Services' growth has been slow, according to Bloomberg, possibly leading to the new program.  Amazon Home Assistants targets a smaller market than Home Services: US consumers were estimated to have spent $16 billion on housecleaning in 2017 by ServiceMaster Global Holdings Inc., as cited by Bloomberg. By directly employing its workers and having more control over the service, Amazon may find more success with this new offering.  Amazon Home Assistants could tie-in well with Amazon's efforts to improve package delivery security. Amazon recently launched its Amazon Key program, which uses smart technology to enable in-home deliveries even when customers aren't home.  The program aims to provide more secure deliveries, thus giving consumers more reasons to buy from Amazon. Home Assistants could help this secure-delivery initiative in two ways: Users without Amazon Key could authorize the assistants to accept packages, increasing their value and Amazon's delivery performance, or Amazon Key could make it possible for users to let the assistants into their homes without being present, incentivizing them to use Amazon Key.  The service may make consumers comfortable with Amazon having a pronounced presence in their homes, benefiting some of the company's other efforts. The e-commerce titan introduced its answer to Best Buy's Geek Squad last July through Smart Home Services by Amazon, offering consultations on what smart home products are best for consumers' homes as well as installations.  However, some consumers are uncomfortable with Amazon being in their living rooms all the time in the form of smart devices, likely hindering the service's success. With Home Assistants regularly in consumers' houses, they may be more apt to use Home Services and buy Amazon smart products, like the Echo, because Amazon will be a constant presence in their lives.

The resulting audio can be played from within the blog post itself, or accessed in podcast form using a feature called Amazon Pollycast, the company says.  The plugin itself was jointly designed by Amazon\u2019s AWS team and managed WordPress platform provider WP Engine, and takes advantage of Amazon\u2019s text-to-speech service, Polly.  First introduced at Amazon\u2019s re:Invent developer event back in November 2016, Polly uses machine learning technologies under the hood to deliver more life-like speech. For example, Polly understands that the word \u201clive\u201d would be pronounced differently based on its usage. In the phrases \u201cI live in Seattle\u201d and \u201cLive from New York,\u201d the word is spelled the same but is not spoken in the same way. That means the voices sound more natural than some other, more basic voice-to-text engines.  The Polly speech engine launched with 47 male and female voice and support for 24 languages. Since then, Amazon added support for Korean, another 5 languages, and made Polly available in all regions in the AWS partition.  The technology\u2019s capabilities have also evolved, with added support for things like whispering, speech marks, a timbre effect, and dynamic range compression. These sorts of voice technology advancements are also things that make Alexa sound more natural, too. Similar to Polly, Alexa learned how to whisper and change the pitch of her voice earlier this year.  The launch of the WordPress plugin is not the first time Polly has been used to turn digital text to speech, of course. The service itself has always been capable of turning any text \u2013 news articles, blog posts, RSS feeds, PDFs, and more \u2013 into audio. However, making this functionality available as a WordPress plugin makes Polly more accessible to a wider audience.  However, the plugin is only available to anyone running their own installation of WordPress on their own infrastructure (hosted or managed) or on AWS, and does require a bit of configuration. That may make it a bit more challenging for less technical types to use. (Instructions are here on the Amazon developer blog and on the plugin\u2019s page.)  Once set up, the plugin makes calls to Amazon Polly whenever a blog post is saved or updated.  In addition to simply reading posts aloud, Polly\u2019s flexibility means you could configure different voices for different bylines, or use different voices for quoted text \u2013 if you\u2019re technically-minded \u2013 these options aren\u2019t available in the plugin itself. (Users can choose from the full selection of Amazon Polly voices to narrate different bylines using the plugin. However, they can\u2019t have different voices in the same reading.)  For podcasters, the plugin includes a feature called Pollycast that lets you control the iTunes parameters that are in the generated RSS feed, like the iTunes category, image, contact email, and explicit content flag.  The Amazon Polly plugin is free, but using Polly is not.  Pricing is based on the number of characters in the speech requests. It\u2019s also worth noting the AWS free tier allows up to 5 million characters per month at no charge for the first year after you begin to use Polly.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-08", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/08/amazon-launches-a-polly-wordpress-plugin-that-turns-blog-posts-into-audio-including-podcasts/"}, {"article": "KERNERSVILLE, N.C. \u2014 As soon as the first robot arrived at a FedEx shipping hub in the heart of North Carolina tobacco country early last year, talk of pink slips was in the air.

Back in the United States, Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, is testing out the Bossa Nova robots in dozens of its locations to reduce some tedious tasks that can eat up a worker\u2019s time. The robots, which look like giant wheeled luggage bags, roll up and down the aisles looking for shelves where cereal boxes are out of stock and items like toys are mislabeled. The machines then report back to workers, who restock the shelves and apply new labels.  At 120 of Walmart\u2019s 4,700 American stores, shoppers can also scan items, including fruits and vegetables, using the camera on their smartphones and pay for them using the devices. When customers walk out, an employee checks their receipts and does a \u201cspot check\u201d of the items they bought.  Kroger, one of the country\u2019s largest grocery chains, has also been testing a mobile scanning service in its supermarkets, recently announcing that it would expand it to 400 of its more 2,700 stores.  New start-ups are seeking to give retailers the technology to compete with Amazon\u2019s system. One of them, AiFi, is working on cashierless checkout technology that it says will be flexible and affordable enough that mom-and-pop retailers and bigger outlets can use it. In the United States, venture capitalists put $100 million into retail automation start-ups in each of the past two years, up from about $64 million in 2015, according Pitchbook, a financial data firm.  Photo  \u201cThere\u2019s a gold rush feeling about this,\u201d said Alan O\u2019Herlihy, chief executive of Everseen, an Irish company working with retailers on automated checkout technology that uses artificial intelligence.  While such technologies could improve the shopping experience, there may also be consequences that people find less desirable. Retailers like Amazon could compile reams of data about where customers spend time inside their doors, comparable to what internet companies already know about their online habits.

Many Chinese citizens have become accustomed to high levels of surveillance, including widespread security cameras and government monitoring of online communications.  Depending on how heavily retailers automate in the years to come, job losses could be severe in a sector that has already experienced wave after wave of store closings by the likes of Macy\u2019s, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and Sears.

Walmart, the largest private employer in the United States, says that it does not anticipate automation will lead to job losses, but rather that the new technologies are meant to redirect employees to spend more time helping customers find what they need.  \u201cWe see this as helping our associates,\u201d said John Crecelius, vice president of central operations at Walmart. \u201cWe are a people-led business that is technology enabled.\u201d  Some traditional retailers are also skeptical about whether the sort of automation in Amazon Go can move to large stores. They say the technology may not work or be cost effective outside a store with a small footprint and inventory.  \u201cThat\u2019s probably not scalable to a 120,000-square-foot store,\u201d said Chris Hjelm, executive vice president and chief information officer at Kroger.  But he said it was just a matter of time before more cameras and sensors were commonplace in stores. \u201cIt\u2019s a few years out,\u201d he said, \u201cbefore that technology becomes mainstream.\u201d", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-01", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/01/technology/retailer-stores-automation-amazon.html"}, {"article": "Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, told reporters on Thursday that \u201cthe president has expressed his concerns with Amazon. We have no actions at this time.\u201d  Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to again single out Amazon and characterize it as a tax cheat and a job killer is a remarkable use of the presidential bully pulpit that could have serious implications for the company even without any formal moves by the federal government.  His comments have already spooked investors, sending Amazon stocks tumbling Wednesday after an article on the website Axios about his anger toward the company. The stock fell further after his tweet on Thursday, though prices rebounded later.  The tech industry is increasingly on the defensive. Facebook is under attack in Washington for its handling of personal data and the social network\u2019s role in the 2016 election. And the recent death of a pedestrian by a self-driving car has renewed criticism of Uber.  \u201cThe general principle that I know deeply concerns the president is that we need to live in a world where the government sets a level playing field between internet vendors and mom and pop stores,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the chair of the president\u2019s council on economic advisers, said Thursday on Fox Business.  Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.  Several current and former officials said that Mr. Trump regularly conflates Amazon with The Post. Mr. Bezos owns the paper privately, separate from his role at Amazon.  Brad Parscale, the president\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, on Thursday channeled Mr. Trump\u2019s anger about The Post in a tweet of his own, saying: \u201cDo not forget to mention that @amazon has probably 10x the data on every American that @facebook does. All that data and own a political newspaper, The @washingtonpost. Hmm\u2026\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  And far-right, conspiracy-fanning websites \u2014 some of which Mr. Trump is known to read \u2014 have for months stoked the idea that The Post is in cahoots with the C.I.A. because the agency contracts with Amazon to provide cloud-based data storage. Last November, a headline at one of those sites, Infowars, said: \u201cBEZOS & DEEP STATE UNITE: AMAZON LAUNCHES CLOUD SERVICE FOR CIA.\u201d  The Post declined to comment.  One person close to Mr. Trump, who asked for anonymity to discuss private discussions in the Oval Office, said that the president mused about the issue of Amazon and taxes at least a half-dozen times in the last six months. The president has repeatedly claimed that Amazon costs the Postal Service money even though officials have explained to him that is not the case. Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.  People close to Mr. Trump say the president is convinced that Amazon unfairly benefits from tax laws. The internet giant collects sales taxes on its own products in all 45 states that have one, but third-party vendors who sell products on the site often do not collect sales tax, a fact that rivals say is unfair. In addition, some municipalities complain that the company does not collect local taxes.  In April, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in an case on whether to allow states to impose sales taxes on all internet sales. Many observers believe the justices are poised to reverse its 1992 ruling that exempted online retailers with no physical presence in a state.

Mr. Trump hears the sales tax complaints frequently during visits with his wealthy friends at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, and in meetings at the White House, several aides and associates said. One person familiar with his thinking said that the president believes many of his core supporters are hurt when Amazon disrupts the local businesses where they live.  The president\u2019s critique is shared by some of his usual adversaries in the Democratic Party. Like many of Mr. Trump\u2019s wealthy Republican friends, Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, has been critical of Amazon\u2019s growing power in the marketplace.  \u201cThe Trump administration should rein in giants like Amazon because they have an unfair stranglehold on the competition, not because the president has a personal feud with a company\u2019s C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Ellison said in a statement on Thursday.  There was also some irony in the criticism coming from Mr. Trump, who has boasted about his dexterity in avoiding paying taxes. \u201cThis is the guy who said that not paying taxes \u2018makes me smart,\u2019\u201d said Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research organization.  How the president could slow Amazon, beyond take to Twitter or complain about the company in speeches, is unclear.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  If Mr. Trump were to pressure the Justice Department to pursue antitrust enforcement action against Amazon, it would be a sharp break from tradition, experts say, because the White House has kept a far distance from those cases for decades.  \u201cIt would be a gross violation and abuse of our due process,\u201d said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.  But the president has repeatedly crossed lines that his predecessors have observed. In the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, he has pressured Justice Department officials to investigate his Democratic rivals and to abandon the investigation of himself and his associates.  AT&T and Time Warner have suggested Mr. Trump played a role in the Justice Department\u2019s decision to block the companies\u2019 $85.4 billion media merger. Makan Delrahim, the head of antitrust at the Justice Department, has said under oath in Congress that he would not allow the White House to impact his decisions over that merger or any other cases.  Mr. Trump also surprised antitrust experts with his swift decision to block Broadcom\u2019s merger with Qualcomm earlier this month, after a review by a government panel on foreign investments. The president has direct authority to block a merger with foreign companies that pose national security concerns.  Amazon has tried, through lobbyists and outside consultants, to meet with administration officials and members of Congress to counter arguments about the company\u2019s tax collection and its relationship with the Postal Service.  The size of company\u2019s lobbying staff has ballooned in recent years, according to public filings, focusing largely on drones, transportation, taxes and cybersecurity. It has hired antitrust consultants over the past year.  In 2015, shortly after Mr. Trump started his attacks against the company, Mr. Bezos joked on Twitter about sending the candidate into space on a rocket made by Blue Origin, a space exploration start-up Mr. Bezos owns.  But when Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee and then president, Mr. Bezos and Amazon stopped responding to his attacks, seeing little upside in a public quarrel with him, according to two people briefed on the decision. The people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private, said that these days, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets were more likely to prompt eye-rolling inside the company than any serious effort at crisis control.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/us/politics/trump-amazon-taxes.html"}, {"article": "A single day after we reported that Amazon is seeking cash-generating blockbusters for distribution on Amazon Prime Video , Amazon has announced that it's hiking up the monthly subscription rate for Amazon Prime.  As of today, if you're paying the monthly rate for Amazon Prime in the US, expect to pay $12.99 during the next billing cycle beginning on February 18. That's an 18% hike from the previous price of $10.99.  The price increase also affects Amazon's monthly plan for students, which will also jump 18% from $5.49 to $6.49.  In a email to TechRadar, Amazon confirmed that the price hike only affects US customers.  Fortunately, the annual rate of $99 will stay the same, as will the standalone $8.99 monthly fee for Amazon Prime Video for those who wish to enjoy Amazon's video content without paying for the shipping and other perks.  Amazon didn't give a concrete reason for the price increase, and instead simply played up the appeal and wide range of services available through Amazon Prime in a prepared statement.  \"Prime provides an unparalleled combination of shipping, shopping and entertainment benefits, and we continue to invest in making Prime even more valuable for our members,\" an Amazon spokesperson said.  Amazon also pointed out that the number of items eligible for two-day shipping recently jumped from 20 million to 100 million, and it called attention to original viewing content on Prime Video such as \"the Golden Globe-winning The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" and The Grand Tour.

The boost was seen as controversial at the time, but, as these things go, it's essentially been accepted as business as usual.  That's partly because Amazon introduced the new monthly plan that's now seeing the price increase a little under two years ago, offering greater flexibility to folks who just want to try out Prime for a while or don't have $99 to throw down all at once.

AMZN -1.22% is scheduled to announce its fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what you need to know:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Amazon to earn $1.85 a share, compared with $1.54 a year ago. The company has forecast an operating income range between $300 million and $1.65 billion, compared with income of $1.26 billion a year ago.  REVENUE FORECAST: Quarterly revenue of $59.83 billion is forecast by the analysts, compared with $43.74 billion a year ago. Amazon said it expected sales of between $56 billion and $60.5 billion for the quarter, which includes growth from its acquisition of Whole Foods.  WHAT TO WATCH:  \u2014HOLIDAYS: Amazon lately has been demonstrating a little more fiscal discipline, something that may pay off with record profitability in its all-important fourth quarter. Already, industry numbers are indicating a positive holiday season for retailers as consumers spent more, something that should benefit Amazon, which has a 40%-plus share of online shopping.  \u2014WHOLE FOODS: Amazon acquired Whole Foods in August, and the fourth quarter is the first full quarter of reporting. Amazon has so far added lockers for package pickups and lowered prices. Analysts will expect some evidence of whether it is paying off. For roughly one month in the third quarter, the grocery chain contributed about $1.28 billion in sales and $21 million in operating income.  \u2014HQ2: Executives may provide an update on its search for a second headquarters. The company earlier this month narrowed its list to 20 from 238. The stakes are high: Amazon has said it plans to create about 50,000 jobs and invest $5 billion over nearly 20 years.  \u2014HEALTH CARE: Amazon on Tuesday said it was joining JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to form a new company focusing on lowering U.S. health-care costs. The companies hope the entire health-care project could at a minimum save them hundreds of millions of dollars, according to a person familiar with the matter. Amazon has more than 300,000 employees in the U.S. after adding Whole Foods, and those benefits are costly. Expect analysts to ask for more clarity on potential cost savings.

REUTERS/Charles Platiau Photo: charles platiau/Reuters  Three technology titans have powered nearly half of the S&P 500\u2019s advance this year, a worrying sign for investors expecting a strengthening economy to lift shares of manufacturers, oil companies and other firms whose fortunes typically improve with growth.  Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% has accounted for 27% of the broader index\u2019s 1.6% gain through Tuesday, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices\u2019 data. That is followed by Microsoft Corp. MSFT -0.53% , which has contributed 13%, and Netflix Inc. at 8.3%. U.S. stocks fell Wednesday, but Amazon and Netflix extended their 2018 gains, adding to their dominance over the S&P 500.  \u201cWhen you see a Netflix or Amazon leading, it\u2019s not necessarily a great sign of investor confidence, since you know those names can always deliver growth no matter what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Jack Ablin, founding partner and chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors.  Investors have fretted in recent years about the dominance of a single sector or stock in the market, but those fears have generally proved unfounded. Markets continued marching higher even after shares of Apple Inc., which was a driver of the rally, stalled for part of 2016.  The S&P 500 technology sector has driven more than three quarters of the index\u2019s gains, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The next biggest contributor is the consumer-discretionary sector\u2014which includes tech-focused Amazon and Netflix\u2014with more than a third of the advance.  To some investors, the continued outperformance of technology-oriented companies is surprising. After the tech sector jumped 37% in 2017, nearly doubling the broader S&P 500\u2019s advance, many investors expected the rally to stall or be overtaken by other sectors.  Among those expected to gain were cyclical stocks like commodity producers, manufacturers and banks whose businesses tend to improve as the economy strengthens and prices rise.  Instead, energy shares have extended their rout, even as U.S. crude prices have bounced off their 2014 lows. Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. have together chipped away about 12% from the S&P 500\u2019s year-to-date advance. And industrial firms, which soared after the 2016 presidential election on bets that the Trump administration would pump up infrastructure spending, have lagged behind the S&P 500, as some investors have questioned how the administration will secure funding for its plan.  Other investors predicted bank shares would begin outperforming the broader market again after the passage of the Republican tax overhaul. And those companies have seen a boost: JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. together have made up 12% of the S&P 500\u2019s 2018 gains, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.  Yet enthusiasm for technology stocks hasn\u2019t tapered off. Roughly a third of global fund managers say they are overweight technology stocks in their portfolios, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey conducted at the start of the month. That was the highest share of overweights of all 11 S&P 500 sectors.  Tech\u2019s dominance has helped the Nasdaq Composite, which heavily weights shares of technology companies, outperform other indexes so far this year.

REUTERS/Chris Helgren/File Photo  The global shipping industry has seen little innovation since the container was invented in the 1950s, and cross-border trade still leaves an enormous trail of paperwork and bureaucracy.  Success of the platform, which will be made available to the ocean shipping industry around mid-2018, depends on whether Maersk and IBM can convince shippers, freight forwarders, ocean carriers, ports and customs authorities to sign up.  Blockchain technology powers the digital currency bitcoin and enables data sharing across a network of individual computers.  It will help manage and track tens of millions of shipping containers globally by digitizing the supply chain process from end to end, the companies said.  \u201cThe big thing that is missing from this industry to digitize and unleash the potential of the technology is really to create a form of utility that brings standards across the entire ecosystem,\u201d Maersk\u2019s Chief Commercial Officer Vincent Clerc said in an interview.  A shipment of refrigerated goods from East Africa to Europe can go through nearly 30 people and organizations and involve more than 200 different communications, according to Maersk. Documentation and bureaucracy can be as much as a fifth of the total cost of moving a container.  \u201cThere is a strong push from the end-customer to see this change. We may meet initial resistance form one part of the ecosystem,\u201d Clerc said.  \u201cThe success of the platform depends on acceptance of all participants.\u201d  Customs and port authorities in the United States, Singapore, the Netherlands and China\u2019s Guangdong province have shown interest in using the platform and some other shipping companies are also interested, he said.  Maersk, which handles one in seven containers shipped globally, sold off its energy business in 2017 to focus entirely on transportation and logistics.  A cyber attack last year caused some of the biggest-ever disruptions to global shipping, displaying the vulnerability of out-dated communication systems.

The charter aims to set a standard for companies to find trustworthy business partners, or avoid those outside that circle, Siemens Chief Executive Officer Joe Kaeser said.  \u201cIf companies along the value chain share their experiences, then we can prevent a lot of things,\u201d said Kaeser, who helped initiate the charter.

The cost of cyber-crime to firms over the next five years could reach $8 trillion, the World Economic Forum said in a report in January.  Signatories of the Munich charter, which also include Allianz AG, Daimler AG, NXP Semiconductors NV, SGS SA and Deutsche Telekom AG, are calling for governments and companies to take responsibility for digital security at the highest levels. They suggest governments set up dedicated ministries devoted to the issue.  Societal Breakdown    Airbus CEO Tom Enders said his company now employs about 1,000 people dealing with a response to cyber attacks, a number he estimates will rise tenfold or more in the next decade, highlighting how the issue is becoming an increasingly central part of large companies\u2019 organisation. New-generation aircraft contain tens of thousands of sensors and are increasingly connected via mobile networks, making the storage and securing of data increasingly complex, he said.  Still, most of of the security breaches that are disclosed via government agencies to companies typically come from the either the U.S. or the U.K., evidence that other European political institutions must do more to collaborate with companies, Enders said.  \u201cWe must not be afraid to share information freely between governments, government agencies and industries,\u201d Enders said.

Chinese universities and U.S. technology companies, such as International Business Machines Corp. and Microsoft Corp., are racing to develop quantum computers, a type of processing that\u2019s forecast to be so powerful it can transform how drug-makers, agriculture companies and auto manufacturers discover compounds and materials.  Quantum computing uses the movement of subatomic particles to process data in amounts that modern computers can\u2019t handle. Mostly theoretical now, the technology is expected to be able to perform calculations that make today\u2019s computers look akin to an abacus.  While overall spending by China is unknown, its government is building a $10 billion National Laboratory for Quantum Information Sciences in Hefei, Anhui Province, which is slated to open in 2020. U.S.-funded research in quantum is about $200 million a year, according to a July 2016 government report, and some researchers and companies don\u2019t believe that\u2019s enough.  Quantifying Quantum Computing U.S. and Chinese are in an arms race to patent innovations in computing's next wave Source: Patinformatics  One \u201ckiller app\u201d may be encryption, the code scrambling technology that secures modern global commerce and communications. China, Chinese universities and western financial institutions are rushing to patent more ways to use quantum technology for encryption, a study by research firm Patinformatics found.  \u2018Unhackable System\u2019  \u201cWe\u2019re talking about encrypting data so it can\u2019t be broken, certainly not by a classical computer,\u201d said Tony Trippe, managing director of Dublin, Ohio-based Patinformatics. \u201cIt would be an unhackable system.\u201d  At the same time, it could break encryption that was on a classical computer. \u201cAn organization or a nation that had quantum computer technologies would have a significantly easier time of wreaking havoc on other systems,\u201d he said.  What\u2019s Intellectual Property and Does China Steal It?: QuickTake  U.S. President Donald Trump accused the Chinese government in March of stealing intellectual property by forcing American companies to share their most valuable secrets and sign joint venture agreements with local firms if they want to operate in China, although there are no specific allegations regarding quantum computers.  Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser, spoke Sunday on NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press\" about the tariffs before shifting to intellectual property.  \"What is at stake here,\" he said, \"is the industries of the future. Artificial intelligence, robotics, quantum computing. And what\u2019s at stake is not just our economic prosperity. If I may, it\u2019s also our national security. Because many of these industries of the future have profound military implications.\"  China\u2019s Innovation  China has also been aggressive in pushing home-grown innovation as it supports companies in obtaining patents and trademarks around the world, and has increased its research funding. In its annual scorecard, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development called China \u201cthe second largest scientific powerhouse,\u201d behind the U.S.  Read More: Who Is Building Canada\u2019s Quantum Brain Trust?  Technology companies from Microsoft to IBM to Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google view quantum computing as the next revolution.  \u201cOver time, quantum in the field of computation is so important is that it will redefine the category of computers themselves,\u201d said Dario Gil, vice president of IBM\u2019s Artificial Intelligence research. \u201cIt is the future of computing.\u201d  IBM\u2019s inventions may be having the most impact on the nascent field, when judged by the number of times its research has been cited by others in their patent applications. The Armonk, New York-based company already has developed computers being tested by customers, including Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, the Energy Department\u2019s biggest lab, as well as finance companies like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays Plc, Gil said.  \u2018Tough Problems\u2019  Intel Corp., which started its own program two years ago, said the technology promises to be \u201ctransformational.\u201d  \u201cThere are many tough problems to solve before quantum computing is a commercial reality,\u201d said Jim Clarke, director of quantum hardware at Intel. \u201cSome of these problems involve materials science, quantum chip design and manufacturing -- those are sweet-spot problems for Intel.\u201d  Clarke said Intel is competitive in the number of patents it\u2019s seeking, though many aren\u2019t yet public. Applications are made public after 18 months.  IBM Makes Breakthrough in Race to Commercialize Quantum Computers  While there will still be a place for what\u2019s being called \u201cclassical computers\u201d -- a category that includes modern smartphones and even super computers -- the quantum computers could have \u201can infinite number of applications\u201d in the fields of life sciences, chemistry and agriculture, said IBM\u2019s Gil.  \u2018Patent the Potential\u2019  It\u2019s too early to say which company or country will be the leader in quantum computers, though at this stage it looks like U.S. companies will excel in hardware while Chinese and Japanese ones are focused on the software and applications, Patinformatics\u2019 Trippe said.  \u201cJapanese and Chinese companies aren\u2019t as concerned about building them as they are about how they\u2019ll be used,\u201d Trippe said. \u201cThey\u2019ve started to patent the potential. The next five years are going to be pretty fascinating.\u201d  The U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission, created by Congress in 2000 to assess national security implications of bilateral trade between the countries, said in its most recent report that China \u201chas closed the technological gap\u201d with the U.S. in quantum information science, a sector Americans have long dominated, \u201cdue to a concerted strategy by the Chinese government and inconsistent and unstable levels of R&D funding and limited government coordination by the United States.\u201d  Quantum Physics  Studies by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Bloomberg have independently shown that China is rising in its overall score for innovation, which includes education, government research and the number of patents. The World Intellectual Property Organization reported March 21 that China is closing in on the U.S. in filing international patent applications.  Quantum physics is one area in which the Chinese government, through its Ministry of Science and Technology, is beefing up its technological prowess, according to a report by the U.S. Trade Representative that laid the groundwork for Trump\u2019s tariff plans. The China Academy of Sciences and Beijing University are among the Chinese research firms seeking more patents on quantum information technology, according to Patinformatics.  The Chinese government invested by giving a lot of money to companies and researchers to \u201creplicate what we did in the U.S. and elsewhere,\u201d said Carl J. Williams, deputy director of the Physical Measurement Laboratory at the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. \u201cThey\u2019ve come a long ways.\u201d  Encryption Focus  The Chinese researchers are focused on encryption, based on their patent applications. In August 2016, China\u2019s state news agency said the government had launched the world\u2019s first quantum communications satellite, and a year later claimed to have sent the first \u201cunbreakable\u201d code from space.  \u201cThat should be very scary,\u201d said Jonathan Dowling, co-director of Louisiana State University\u2019s Hearne Institute for Theoretical Physics, \u201cat least to the intelligence agencies.\u201d  In the U.S., the Department of Energy, Naval Research Lab and defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp. are among the government entities or contractors researching quantum computers. Overall, though, the U.S. government has cut back on its own funding of computing and cryptography hardware, Dowling said.  \u2018Considered a Priority\u2019  A July 2016 report by the National Science and Technology Council under former President Barack Obama recommended it be \u201cconsidered a priority for federal coordination and investment.\u201d  In the coming age of quantum, it\u2019s an open question whether federal funding will enable the U.S to maintain the edge it\u2019s had during the PC era and smartphone wars. Scott Crowder, IBM\u2019s chief technology officer for quantum computing, told a House panel in October that \u201cthe U.S. government investment in driving this critical technology is not sufficient to stay competitive.\u201d  LSU\u2019s Dowling said it could mean the U.S. comes out the loser in the quantum race.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a bunch of different things going on at once with no overall organization,\u201d LSU\u2019s Dowling said, \u201cunlike in China, where they are exactly sure what they\u2019re doing.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Dina Bass, Jeremy Kahn, and Ian King", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-09", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-08/forget-the-trade-war-china-wants-to-win-the-computing-arms-race"}, {"article": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 IBM reported its first quarter of revenue growth in more than five years as the company ramps up its cloud computing business and looks for new opportunities from its investments in artificial intelligence.  \"Over the past several years we have invested aggressively in technology and our people to reposition IBM,\" James Kavanaugh, IBM's new chief financial officer, said in a statement Thursday after the company reported its fourth-quarter earnings.

Youtube  At a congressional hearing this week, Jerry Cuomo, IBM's vice president of blockchain technology, testified about the potential governmental uses for blockchains.  Identification documents, payment systems, and systems that trace the movement of foods and drugs, are among the most promising initial governmental applications for the technology, Cuomo said.  Lawmakers were wowed by how much quicker blockchain technology has made the process of tracking down food products.  IBM wants to get Uncle Sam on a blockchain.  The digital ledger technology that underlies bitcoin is ready to be used for everything from paying taxes to tracking food and drug shipments to newer, more secure identification cards, said Jerry Cuomo, vice president of blockchain technology at IBM, at a hearing Wednesday organized by the Congressional Blockchain Caucus.  \"There is an opportunity for the United States to build upon its momentum to lead blockchain by doing,\" Cuomo said in his testimony. \"We should focus our efforts on projects that can positively impact US economic competitiveness, citizens, and businesses.\"  Cuomo encouraged lawmakers to focus on incorporating blockchain technology into already established governmental projects and programs, rather than trying to start new blockchain-themed initiatives. That could help speed its use and adoption and help the US stay at the forefront of blockchain development, he said.  Government agencies at both the federal and state level are already experimenting with the technology. Some states are developing blockchain-based drivers licenses and identification cards. Meanwhile, IBM is working with the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on some blockchain projects, including one that could speed the CDC's ability to develop new drugs.  Right now, drug development involves lots of paperwork. Blockchain technology could help improve the process by putting all of the important information related to drug development in an easily accessible and secure place online.  Developing new drugs \"doesn't just take a long time because people are slow,\" Cuomo said. \"The processes are extremely paper intensive. I see these groups taking the right first steps.\"  In an interview with Business Insider, Cuomo predicted that blockchain-based digital identities will be the first big project to take off at the federal level, because officials can build off the work going on in the states.  In addition to Cuomo, Frank Yiannas, vice president of food safety at Walmart, also testified at the hearing, talking about how his company is using blockchain technology. The retail giant has teamed up with IBM to develop a blockchain designed to track the movement of produce from farmers through distributors and stores to consumers. The technology could be useful in responding to reports of food contamination, when entities like the FDA need to quickly determine which food to recall.  When Yiannas told lawmakers that the process of tracking down particular food products has gone from seven days to to 2.2 seconds, thanks to blockchain technology, they were in awe, Cuomo said.

Typically, machine learning models need to be trained on large amounts of data to ensure that they are accurate, but for many problems, that large data set simply doesn\u2019t exist.  High, however, believes this is a solvable problem. Why? \u201cBecause humans do it. We have a data point,\u201d he said. One thing to keep in mind is that even when we see that evidenced in what humans are doing, you have to recognize it\u2019s not just that session, it\u2019s not just that moment that is informing how humans learn. We bring all of this context to the table.\u201d For High, it\u2019s this context that\u2019ll make possible training models with less data, as well as recent advances in transfer learning, that is, the ability to take one trained model and then use this data to kickstart the training of another model where less data may exist.  The challenges for AI \u2014 and especially conversational AI \u2014 go beyond that, though. \u201cOn the other end is really trying to understand how better to interact with humans in ways that they would find natural and that are influential to their thinking,\u201d says High. \u201cHumans are influenced by not just the words that they exchange but also by how we encase those words in vocalizations, inflection, intonation, cadence, temper, facial expression, arm and hand gestures.\u201d High doesn\u2019t think an AI necessarily needs to mimic these in some kind of anthropomorphic form, but maybe in some other form like visual cues on a device.  At the same time, most AI systems also still need to get better at understanding the intent of a question and how that relates to individuals\u2019 previous questions about something, as well as their current state of mind and personality.  That brings up another question, though. Many of these machine learning models that are in use right now are inherently biased because of the data with which they were trained. That often means that a given model will work great for you if you\u2019re a white male but then fails black women, for example. \u201cFirst of all, I think that there\u2019s two sides to that equation. One is, there may be aggregate bias to this data and we have to be sensitive to that and force ourselves to consider data that broadens the cultural and demographic aspects of the people it represents,\u201d said High. \u201cThe flip side of that, though, is that you actually want aggregate bias in these kind of systems over personal bias.\u201d  As an example, High cited work IBM did with the Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. IBM and the hospital trained a model based on the work of some of the best cancer surgeons. \u201cBut Sloan Kettering has a particular philosophy about how to do medicine. So that philosophy is embodied in their biases. It\u2019s their institutional biases, it\u2019s their brand. [\u2026] And any system that is going to be used outside of Sloan Kettering needs to carry that same philosophy forward.\u201d  \u201cA big part of making sure that these things are biased in the right way is both making sure that you have the right people submitting for and who these people are representative of \u2014 of the broader culture.\u201d That\u2019s a discussion that High says now regularly comes up with IBM\u2019s clients, too, which is a positive sign in an industry that still often ignores these kind of topics.", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-27", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/ibm-watson-cto-rob-high-on-bias-and-other-challenges-in-machine-learning/"}, {"article": "IBM is hard at work on the problem of ubiquitous computing, and its approach, understandably enough, is to make a computer small enough that you might mistake it for a grain of sand.

Look closer:  It\u2019s an evolution of IBM\u2019s \u201ccrypto anchor\u201d program, which uses a variety of methods to create what amounts to high-tech watermarks for products that verify they\u2019re, for example, from the factory the distributor claims they are, and not counterfeits mixed in with genuine items.  The \u201cworld\u2019s smallest computer,\u201d as IBM continually refers to it, is meant to bring blockchain capability into this; the security advantages of blockchain-based logistics and tracking could be brought to something as benign as a bottle of wine or box of cereal.  In addition to getting the computers extra-tiny, IBM intends to make them extra-cheap, perhaps 10 cents apiece. So there\u2019s not much of a lower limit on what types of products could be equipped with the tech.

With these new tools, developers can develop their models with the same open source frameworks they are likely already using (think TensorFlow, Caffe, PyTorch, Keras etc.). Indeed, IBM\u2019s new service essentially offers these tools as cloud-native services and developers can use a standard Rest API to train their models with the resources they want \u2014 or within the budget they have.

Consumers go about their lives, numbed by the frequency and the lack of consequences. Meanwhile, the hacks get worse.

The simple grading system used by restaurant regulators can and should be a model to inform the public about the digital security of businesses that store sensitive consumer data. A letter grade is a crude measure to assess a complex issue like cybersecurity to be sure, but what the metric lacks in nuance it makes up for with brute force.  Current measures to assess cyber-preparedness are either not compulsory or too complex. The federal government\u2019s National Institute of Standards and Technology framework is widely respected, but it\u2019s voluntary, underused and not easily digestible for the average consumer. Only seven Fortune 500 companies mentioned it in their annual filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, and only one said it had adopted it.  MSCI \u2014 an index provider and independent research firm for institutional investors \u2014 ranks companies on cybersecurity. More than a year before Equifax\u2019s breach was revealed, MSCI scored Equifax a 0 out of 10 on privacy and data security. As prescient as it was, consumers would have had difficulty absorbing such a rating, which is just one of several components that MSCI uses to arrive at an environmental, social and governance, or E.S.G., rating of overall corporate citizenship.  A new grading system should start with the basics: Are companies on top of data security, and if hacked, do they know how to reduce the impact?  Each year, the Ponemon Institute, an independent research group, and IBM look at the cost of the average data security breach, as well as the average cost of each piece of data compromised. In 2017, the average cost of a data breach in the United States was $7.35 million, or $141 per record compromised. But if a company has an incident response team, uses encryption, trains its employees, has a business continuity program and monitors cyber-threat intelligence, that reduces the cost of the average data breach by nearly 47 percent. Using these five factors \u2014 weighed for their impact of cost reduction \u2014 is a simple starting point.  There are plenty of details to be worked out about a cybersecurity grading system. But the one nonnegotiable aspect would be that, once assigned, letter grades must be made highly accessible to the public. Companies should be required to display their grades prominently at their physical locations, on their websites, on certain documents (mortgage applications, for example) and on credit card readers.

Our behaviour is changing as a result of an information and communications overload, both at work and in our personal lives. Finding a way to manage the barrage is an important challenge as the information economy develops.  Distractions at work, such as the constant inflow of emails, notifications and pop-up chats, take their toll. One study, by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, found that the mere prospect of being distracted by a ringing mobile phone reduced test participants\u2019 cognition skills, measured by a test involving reading a passage of text and being asked questions about it.  Our addiction to smartphones and social media is also making us more fidgety. One study of Android users by research company Dscout found that people tapped, swiped and clicked their smartphones 2,617 times a day. Apple\u2019s products are sufficiently addictive to prompt activist investors to demand research be done into the negative impacts of phone use on children. There is growing concern about a mental health crisis in young people caused by the addictiveness of social media, the internet, and gaming.  When you get bored you ignite the \u2018default mode\u2019 in your brain, and this is where we do our most original thinking  \u201cThere is nothing new about the existence of an attention economy that monetises our eyeballs,\u201d says Cal Newport, associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University and author of Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World. \u201cBut when you combine this business model with powerful handheld devices that are always connected to the internet, algorithms being weaponized to extract as much of our time and attention as possible, and hundreds of billions of dollars of investment, suddenly the societal impacts become worrisome.\u201d  Prof Newport is worried about the next generation. \u201cIt is almost certainly true that young people are suffering a rapid decline in their ability to concentrate. Given the increasing share of the economy dedicated to knowledge work, in which concentrated thought is the primary driver of value production, this decline might start to impact large scale economic metrics, if it hasn\u2019t already\u201d.  Overcoming overload is hard, because we are addicted to information \u2014 or, more specifically, to novelty  If information overload stops us concentrating deeply, it also stops us resting deeply \u2014 and that is just as damaging. Boredom, zoning out and absent-mindedness are all fertile mental states for creativity. \u201cWe\u2019re at an interesting moment in neuroscience in terms of understanding how boredom is a gateway to mind-wandering,\u201d says Manoush Zomorodi, host of the WNYC podcast Note to Self and author of Bored and Brilliant.  \u201cWhen you get bored, say you are folding laundry, or doing something that doesn\u2019t require focused attention, you ignite the \u2018default mode\u2019 in your brain, and this is where we do our most original thinking,\u201d she says. \u201cWe take two seemingly disparate ideas and smash them together to make something new. And we do autobiographical planning. We look back at our life, take note of highs and lows, create personal narratives, and look at our future and decide where we want to go.\u201d  If in a quiet moment we instead check for emails or social media updates, then we may be in danger of losing the experience of boredom entirely.  Overcoming overload is hard, because we are addicted to information \u2014 or, more specifically, to novelty. This was helpful in the hunter-gatherer era, because it could lead us to food and resources. It is less helpful online, where we cannot ever be satiated. Companies are tapping this foraging-related brain circuitry to make products more addictive. One gamification firm, with clients including Disney and Google, even named itself Dopamine, after the brain chemical.  Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest names are raising the alarm, from Facebook\u2019s founding president Sean Parker to former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris.  Is there a solution?  \u00a9 EPA  Yet there are glimmers of hope. Consumers, and even investors, are paying more attention to the problem. Facebook published a study confirming that its users do indeed feel worse after \u2018passively\u2019 consuming social media. It argued however that social media increased wellbeing when people used them actively, especially when \u201csharing messages, posts and comments with close friends and reminiscing about past interactions\u201d. It recently announced changes to its news feed, to prioritise the sharing of meaningful content between friends.  At work, companies are deploying software, artificial intelligence and machine learning to bring order and structure to the informational chaos that many office workers now feel. Slack can reduce email overload by shifting high-volume, open-ended communications into chat forums. IBM Verse and SalesforceIQ sift information and prioritise actions for staff. Google has rolled out auto-reply suggestions on Gmail, with algorithms proposing possible replies to messages, and tools like Evernote consolidate scattered online and offline notes, links and resources.  Then there are the apps and internet blockers which forcibly disconnect people from certain sites, or during certain times, including Thrive App, from Arianna Huffington\u2019s wellbeing consultancy and Samsung.  The power of the humble notebook  Meanwhile Prof Newport, who gained tenure at the young age of 33 without working in the evenings or at weekends, says the humble notebook is his tool of choice. His reasons are subtle, relating to the ways in which the finitude of three dimensional space shapes our thinking. \u201cWhen scheduling your day in a notebook, the fact that the page is a fixed size embodies the reality that your time and attention are limited commodities. Days scheduled on paper tend to be more realistic and balanced than those driven [by] a bottomless inbox or voluminous digital task list.\u201d  Research also shows that writing on paper fires up the brain circuitry associated with language processing and engenders more attentive reading. All of which might give us reason to pause before rolling out the tablets, laptops and digital education for an already screen-sapped generation.

The thing is, while quantum computing is a technology for the world of tomorrow, it hasn't yet advanced far enough for anyone to know what that world will actually look like.  \"People aren't going to just wake up in three or four years, and say, 'Oh okay, now I'm ready to use quantum, what do I have to learn,'\" Bob Sutor, VP of IBM Q Strategy and Ecosystem at IBM Research, told Engadget.  These systems rely on the \"spooky\" properties of quantum physics, as Einstein put it, and their operation is radically different from how today's computers work. \"What you're basically doing is you're replacing the notion of bits with something called qubits,\" Sutor said. \"Ultimately when you measure a qubit it's zero or one, but before that there's a realm of freedom of what that can actually be. It's not zero and one at the same time or anything like this, it just takes on values from a much, much larger mathematical space.  \"The basic logic gates [AND, OR, NOT, NOR, etc], those gates are different for quantum,\" he continued. \"The way the different qubits work together to get to a solution is completely different from the way the bits within your general memory works.\" Rather than tackling problems in sequence, as classical computers do, quantum rigs attempt to solve them in parallel. This enables quantum computers to solve certain equations, such as modeling complex molecules, far more efficiently.  This efficiency, however, is tempered by the system's frailty. Currently, a qubit's coherence time tops out at 90 microseconds before decaying. That is, if a qubit is designated as a 1, it'll only remain a 1 for 0.0009 seconds. \"After that all bets are off. You've got a certain amount of time in which to actually use this thing reliably,\" Sutor said. \"Any computations you're going to do with a qubit have to come within that period.\"  As such quantum computers are highly sensitive to interference from temperature, microwaves, photons, even the electricity running the machine itself. Sutor said, \"With heat you've got lots of electrons moving around, bumping into each other,\" which can lead to the qubit's decoherence. That's why these rigs have to be cooled to near absolute zero on order to operate.  \"Outer space in the shade is between two and three degree Kelvin,\" Sutor explained. \"Outer space is much too warm to do these types of calculations.\" Instead, the lowest levels of a quantum computer rig, where the calculations themselves take place, exist at a frosty 10 millikelvin -- a hundreth of a degree above absolute zero. So no, Sutor assured Engadget, we probably shouldn't expect desktop quantum computers running at room temperature to exist within the next few decades -- perhaps even within our lifetimes.  Surprisingly, these systems are fairly energy efficient. Aside from the energy needed to sufficiently cool the system for operation (a process that takes around 36 hours) IBM's 50-qubit rig only draws 10 to 15 kilowatts of power -- roughly equivalent to 10 standard microwave ovens.  So now that IBM has developed a number of quantum computer systems ranging from 5 to 50 qubits, the next challenge is figuring out what to do with them. And that's where the company's Q network comes in. Last December, IBM announced that it's partnering with a number of Fortune 500 companies and research institutes -- including JPMorgan Chase, Samsung, Honda, Japan's Keio University, Oak Ridge National Lab and Oxford University -- to suss out potential practical applications for the technology.  Learning centers like Keio University also act as localized hubs. \"We in IBM research, while we have a large team on this, we can't work with everybody in the world who wants to work on quantum computing,\" Sutor explained. These hubs, however, \"can work with local companies, local colleges, whomever to do whatever. They would get their quantum computer power from us, but they would be at the front lines.\" The same is true for Oakridge National Lab, Oxford University and the University of Melbourne.  What's more, the company has also launched the IBM Q experience which allows anyone -- businesses, universities, even private citizens -- to write and submit their own quantum application or experiment to be run on the company's publicly available quantum computing rig. It's essentially a cloud service for quantum computations. So far more than 75,000 people have taken advantage of the service, running more than 2.5 million calculations which have resulted in more than two dozen published research papers on subjects ranging from quantum phase space measurement to homomorphic encryption.  But while the public's interest in this technology is piqued, there is a significant knowledge gap that must be overcome before we start to see quantum applications proliferate the way classical programs did in the 1970s and '80s. \"Let's say in the future you're running investment house types of calculations [similar to the financial risk applications that JP Morgan is currently developing],\" Sutor points out, \"there are big questions as to what those would be, and what the algorithms would be. We're way too early to have anything determined like that, even to the extent of knowing how well [quantum computing] will be applicable in some of these other areas.\"  The entry point for writing programs is a challenge too. For classical computers, it's as simple as running a compiler. But there's not yet such a function for quantum computers. \"What does it mean to optimize a quantum program knowing that this completely different from the model that's in your phone?\" he queried.  Another challenge that must be overcome is how to scale these machines. As Sutor points out, it's a simple enough task to add qubits to silicon chips, but every component added, increases the amount of heat generated and the amount of energy needed to keep the system within its operational temperature boundaries.  So rather than simply packing in more and more qubits and setting off a quantum version of Moore's Law, Sutor believes that the next major step forward for this technology is quality over quantity. \"Having 50 great qubits is much more powerful than having 2,000 lousy ones,\" he quipped. \"You don't want something very noisy that you're going to have to fix,\" but instead research should focus on improving the system's fidelity over increasing the qubit count.", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-23", "source": "engadget", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/23/ibm-q-quantum-computer-experiments/"}, {"article": "Existing designs that typically use non-crystalline solid or amorphous materials have difficulties controlling that flow of ions, which means they're not that successful in moving info from neuron to neuron. To solve that issue, the team created synapses using silicon wafer and silicon germanium, a material commonly used in transistors. Team leader Jeehwan Kim said that together, the \"two perfectly mismatched materials can form a funnel-like dislocation, creating a single path through which ions can flow.\"  They tested their creation by using it on a chip for their neural network, which they fed with tens of thousands of handwriting samples. The result? It was able to recognize handwriting 95 percent of the time -- not bad, seeing as current algorithms powered by typical hardware have a 97 percent accuracy.  Neuromorphic computing will be able to do lot more than recognize handwritten samples, though. In the future, it could lead to portable AI devices much more powerful than your already impressive modern smartphone. \"Ultimately we want a chip as big as a fingernail to replace one big supercomputer,\" Kim said. \"This opens a stepping stone to produce real artificial hardware.\"  [ From left: MIT researchers Scott H.

Strong security and privacy are now at the forefront of the average user's concerns, especially when it comes to banking, financial, online marketplaces, and their email accounts.  That's a sharp contrast to research from Gartner in 2008, which also surveyed 4,000 people and found that most consumers didn't want to change the way they did passwords or security, and were highly resistant to using password managers or adopting additional security measures around log-ins.  \"Despite widespread security concerns,\" Gartner concluded ten years ago, \"consumers continue to rely on service providers to protect their safety and persist in using unsafe password management practices, preferring to maintain the status quo rather than exploring new security methods.\"  IBM's 2018 report surveyed nearly 4,000 adults from around the world. Most respondents were in the US. Over half said they would never trade security for convenience. Like, never.  That sentiment increased with age. IBM's findings showed that 53 percent of 18-23 year olds were in the \"no trade-offs\" camp, whereas this sentiment increased in older people. At the end of the spectrum where the olds were, 84 percent of people 55 and older said that nope, they'd never ever sacrifice security for convenience.  Sadly it was only people who said this, and not corporations, who are sometimes people, but are always sacrificing our security for their convenience.  Additionally, IBM found that 74 percent of consumers said they'd prefer to use extra security like two-factor authentication, extra passwords, or any other additional step for added protection. If they could, they would. Interestingly, the study said that \"36 percent of those ages 18 - 20 say they use password managers to keep passwords and avoid having to memorize them, compared to only 26 percent of users in the general population.\"  It all comes down to trust. Between Yahoo's flaming 3 billion user security disaster, Equifax's negligent ongoing dumpster fire, and Facebook's endless compromises of our personal security, consumers have turned a corner from thinking that large companies have their security acts together.  Perhaps what's surprising is not that people would choose better security over letting some company make their logins \"frictionless,\" but that they're willing to do something about it. That includes rage-quitting whoever screwed up their security. IBM's report found that in the wake of a breach, one in five users will stop using an affected app or service, or move to a competitor's service. The younger the user, the more likely they'll dump whoever got breached and take their trust somewhere else.  I can only imagine the amount of resentment building against companies people can't switch away from, like Equifax, Anthem (BlueCross BlueShield), or government agencies such as the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  The debate about trade-offs between security and convenience is an old one. But now it looks like the idea that users do whatever is easiest is just as dated. Now people know the risks. And no one trusts companies with their security or privacy anymore.  \"For apps related to finances (banking, investing and budgeting),\" the study detailed, \"people vastly ranked security as top priority (70 percent on average) over privacy or convenience (16 percent and 14 percent respectively) -- yet when it came to social media, convenience took a slight lead (36 percent convenience, 34 percent security, 30 percent privacy).\"  One of the extra security steps making its way into mainstream use is biometrics, like fingerprint, face, retina, and palm scanning. Samsung is working on phones that scan your palm; LG wants to use your voice; the Galaxy S8 already uses retinal scans. A Dubai airport plans to replace security counters with facial recognition scans. Mastercard is adding fingerprint scanners to its credit cards. And of course, flagship Androids and iPhones all come with fingerprint and Face ID options.  It's all been met with conflicting reactions of excitement and anxiety from consumers, security professionals, and privacy pundits. Their concerns are all well-founded, and as my colleague Cherlynn Low put it, \"After Apple first put Touch ID on the iPhone 5s in 2013, people pointed out that it didn't work very well and that it wasn't secure.\"  Yet IBM's study shows biometric security to be an inevitability consumers are starting to embrace. Its data showed that 67 percent of respondents are comfortable with using biometrics for security, with a whopping 87 percent willing to consider using different types of biometric authentication in the future.  Even still, everyone's biggest concerns with biometrics are privacy and security. According to IBM, 55 percent of respondents are worried about how their data will be collected and used, with 50 percent saying they're concerned about people using faked biometric credentials to break into their accounts.  So maybe it's time for companies and their infosec advisors to start trusting users with more options for individuating the ways we can lock down our own security on their services. Instead of trying to corral us into whatever must-be-numbers-and-letters half-baked password recipe voodoo they think is best. While their own IT decision makers bump around in the dark prioritizing patches instead of actually applying them. I dunno. It's just a thought.

Qubits (the quantum version of traditional bits) are very unstable and can be adversely affected by noise, and most of these systems can only hold a state for less than 100 microseconds. Google believes that quantum supremacy can be \"comfortably demonstrated\" with 49 qubits and a two-qubit error below 0.5 percent. Previous quantum systems by Google have given two-qubit errors of 0.6 percent, which in theory sounds like a miniscule difference, but in the world of quantum computing remains significant.  However, each Bristlecone chip features 72 qubits, which may help mitigate some of this error, but as Google says, quantum computing isn't just about qubits. \"Operating a device such as Bristlecone at low system error requires harmony between a full stack of technology ranging from software and control electronics to the processor itself,\" the team writes in a blog post. \"Getting this right requires careful systems engineering over several iterations.\"  Google's been vocal about its efforts in quantum computing for years -- back in 2015 it proudly announced a breakthrough that showed huge potential for quantum algorithms, for example -- but every other major tech company has a similar agenda.

Many people are waiting [for] me to announce that we are, uh, partnership with a carrier. Many of you guys have seen the newspapers that something is happened. That, uh, unfortunately this time, we cannot, uh, have this, uh, uh, to sell this phone, you know, from the carrier channel.\" Yu laughs nervously as he says this. \"Everybody knows that in the US market, that, uh ... over 90 percent of smartphones are sold by the carrier channels,\" he adds. Whether it's due to nerves or frustration, his almost-candid rantlet is refreshing, his motivation clear. Yu has had enough.  For years, Huawei has made phones that are well-received by global and American media alike. In the US, however, the company's devices are consistently criticized for not being sold through a carrier. Like Yu says, a vast majority of phones bought in the US are from carriers, and the apparent inability to make a phone that passes stringent carrier requirements not only limits Huawei's access to American customers but also makes the company seem incompetent.  The thing is, Huawei is anything but. In recent years, its phones have greatly improved in quality, especially when it comes to design. It seemed to have finally gained enough momentum to achieve carrier buy-in, with multiple reports saying the company had clinched AT&T's approval to sell the Mate 10 Pro. Yu's speech seems to confirm this, although he never mentions the reason for the dissolution of the partnership. The Information reported that political reasons were behind the last-minute pullout while Reuters said shortly after that Congress lobbied for AT&T to drop the deal.  In its official statement, Huawei doesn't directly address the deal and why it fell through. \"We have the strongest confidence in our products and will continue to innovate and break new ground. At the same time, we believe that U.S. consumers deserve equal opportunity and the choice to enjoy the best technology and more smartphone options through more channels, just like other satisfied Huawei users around the world,\" the company writes.  Huawei isn't the only major Chinese company with its eyes locked on America. Baidu, which is Google's equivalent in China, showed off a trio of smart speakers at CES, and company reps told Engadget that it definitely wants to bring its products to the US. Alibaba, also known as China's Amazon, also wants to establish a presence in America. But there are many challenges clouding these companies' ability to forecast a timeline.  In Baidu's case, tweaking its smart speakers for the US involves a complete overhaul. Its natural language interface DuerOS not only needs to be tailored for different consumer behavior but also has to learn an entirely new language (and all the associated nuances). Basically, American and Chinese people have different habits and tastes, and a product for one market cannot simply be reskinned to suit the other.  Chinese companies simply don't have a good reputation in the US.  Chinese companies also frequently have names that Americans find hard to pronounce, like Xiaomi and Huawei. This affects the consumer's ability to recall the brand when deciding what to buy, making it even more difficult for Chinese companies to appeal to the US market. The problem is so bad that Huawei has had to launch a massive ad campaign teaching Americans how to pronounce its name (\"who-ah way\" in Chinese, \"wah-way\" in Cantonese, \"wow way\" in the company's unfortunately inaccurate marketing material). Xiaomi, which is frequently mispronounced as \"show-me\" actually sounds closer to \"see-ow me.\"  But it's not just language and cultural differences that get in the way. Chinese companies simply don't have a good reputation in the US. Right after Yu's press conference at CES, Congress quickly proposed a bill to ban government agencies from working with Huawei and ZTE. These two companies were also the subject of a 2012 report from Congress claiming they \"cannot be trusted.\"  Huawei writes in its official statement that \"privacy and security are always our first priority. We are compliant with the world's most stringent privacy protection frameworks, including all GAPP and GDPR privacy protection requirements.\" Both ZTE and Huawei also stated back in 2012 that they felt they were being unfairly singled out in Congress' inquiry.", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-17", "source": "engadget", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/17/huawei-china-us-tech-trade-relations/"}, {"article": "Regarding Rep. Robert Pittenger\u2019s \u201cHow China Pushes the Limits on Military Technology Transfer\u201d (op-ed, March 14): Few Americans would argue against measures to make this country more secure, and most would agree that protecting national security requires the proper tools. Still, many more would agree that being factual when discussing this topic is absolutely critical.  Legislation recently introduced in Congress and advocated in these pages by Rep. Robert Pittenger would make some needed improvements to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (Cfius). For example, the measure would expand the ability of the government to block the purchase of buildings or other real estate near military installations.  But Mr. Pittenger\u2019s bill\u2014the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act\u2014goes much, much farther. It would drastically expand the mission of Cfius, an interagency committee staffed by fewer than a dozen people at the Treasury Department, bringing under government review countless international sales and licensing transactions by U.S. companies.  The new remit of Cfius would include such things as standard computer service and support contracts, technology manuals needed to operate machinery purchased by foreign customers and even the licensing of trademarks. Technologies that never were deemed sensitive by the Defense Department or that were long ago removed from control by the U.S. and its allies would be subject to new and opaque regulation by Cfius.  More concerning is that Mr. Pittenger\u2019s bill would do all of this unilaterally\u2014without any effort at cooperation with our allies. The U.S. does not have a monopoly on innovative technologies. Congress can impose all the restrictions it wants on U.S. businesses. But, if America does not work with allies to enact similar controls, we will fail to protect both national security and our economic competitiveness.  In making his case to expand Cfius, Rep. Pittenger has misrepresented the facts. He cites examples of technology sold overseas by IBM and other companies that the U.S. government itself long ago ruled were nonsensitive and able to be freely sold around the world without a government license. In fact, everything IBM has done globally complies with U.S. and foreign export-control laws. For instance, sharing widely published, open-source software, or technology to assemble computer servers that are years behind state of the art, isn\u2019t threatening and therefore not legally controlled for export. But assisting with China\u2019s high-performance computing project is rightly prohibited by U.S. law, and the assertion that IBM has done so is flatly untrue.  Instead of putting thousands of nonsensitive transactions under review by a small committee that has neither the staff nor the experience to handle them, the better approach would be to update the export-control system we already have. A bipartisan bill introduced by Reps. Ed Royce and Eliot Engel, leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, would modernize export controls to deal with emerging challenges.  Congress could also require that technology controls be kept up-to-date. The Departments of Commerce and State\u2014which are today responsible for administering controls on dual-use and military technologies\u2014have between them 500 experts, a transparent process of licensing and deep technical knowledge. But the Militarily Critical Technologies List, mandated by Congress as the baseline for what to control, hasn\u2019t been updated by the Defense Department since 2011.  As recent history has shown, controlling sensitive technology works best when done internationally, with a sharp focus on those technologies that are the most critical. Casting too broad a net on routine business risks losing focus on the real threats. Creating a new bureaucracy, instead of modernizing the one we already have, would be misguided.  Rep. Pittenger should get his facts straight. And Congress should act, both to improve Cfius and to update export controls, but it should use the proper tools for the proper job.  Christopher Padilla  IBM  Washington  Mr. Padilla is vice president for government and regulatory affairs at IBM. He was assistant secretary of commerce responsible for export controls from 2006-2007.  Rep. Pittenger\u2019s piece is premised on inaccurate claims about GE that undermine his arguments to reform government oversight of foreign acquisitions. We are a 125-year-old American company that has worked closely with the U.S. government and military for decades. Rep. Pettinger\u2019s insinuation that GE would compromise our national security to do business in China is offensive and untrue. While we, like many global companies, have joint ventures in China, all of them are consistent with U.S. law, and in many instances were established in close consultation with the U.S. government.  Rep. Pittenger never contacted GE to fact-check his allegations. In truth, GE supports Cfius reform, including strengthening the federal resources devoted to reviews of inbound investments and focusing the review on sectors of highest priority. What we don\u2019t support is the expansion of Cfius\u2019s jurisdiction to outbound U.S. investments into joint ventures around the world (not just in China). Doing so would set back both U.S. national security and economic interests, creating a new bureaucracy that is completely redundant with the existing U.S. export control system. It would generate thousands of additional cases for an already underresourced Cfius system, reduce the likelihood of a coordinated approach with our closest allies and needlessly damage American companies and their workers seeking to compete abroad.  Unfounded attacks like those made by Rep. Pittenger are unhelpful to the complex challenge the U.S. faces in safeguarding sensitive U.S. technology while enabling companies to compete in global markets.

One of the most important such lenses is the impact of IT on business processes, that is, on how work is actually done across the various functions of an organization.  IT-driven business process has gone through three distinct phases. First came process automation in the early years of IT, where companies automated and improved their existing processes while leaving the underlying structure of the organization in place. Then came enterprise-wide process reengineering and management, where the job was to redesign the flow of work and integrate management of the various process within the enterprise. The third phase is now starting, focused on the processes and transactions that determine how institutions interact with each other around the world. Here, blockchain is set to play a role.  Automation, reengineering and integrated management of business processes have had a major impact on lowering the costs and improving the efficiency of transactions within a firm. But as we well know, the internet and globalization have significantly increased the volume of transactions and other interactions taking place among institutions around the world. The processes to manage the conduct of business among companies have not kept up with the economy\u2019s digital transformation, adding significant frictions and costs to their operations.  According to a 2016 IBM report, three major types of frictions predominate when conducting business among different institutions:  Information frictions: Participants in a transaction don\u2019t have access to the same information; the required information is not easily accessible; and security and privacy risks keep rising, \u2013 e.g., hacking, cybercrime, identity theft.  Interaction frictions: Intermediaries are needed to help deal with growing scale and complexity; transactions take longer due to arcane global processes; and a lack of trusted marketplaces in many economies around the world.  Innovation frictions: These include legacy systems, bureaucratic processes and institutional inertia; restrictive regulations that stifle innovation and change; and growing uncertainties and threats that make it harder to move forward.  Blockchains have the potential to significantly reduce these various frictions by bringing one of the most important and oldest concepts, the ledger, to the internet age. Ledgers constitute a permanent record of all the economic transactions an institution handles, whether it\u2019s a bank managing deposits, loans and payments; a brokerage house keeping track of stocks and bonds; a global company conducting business with its supply chain partners; or a government office recording births and deaths, the ownership and sale of land and houses, or legal identity documents like passports and driver licenses.  \u201cToday, transactions are recorded in multiple ledgers,\u201d noted the IBM report. \u201cEach one captures at best a moment in time and reflects the information held by a single party: Bank X purchased or sold a mortgage, for example. They don\u2019t record what happens next, what came before, or the role of others \u2013 partners, suppliers, consumers \u2013 in the transaction. Moreover, they\u2019re prone to human error and vulnerable to tampering. By contrast, distributed ledgers can be shared and updated in near real-time across a group of participants.\u201d  Blockchain technologies hold great promise for global supply chains ecosystems by increasing the speed, security and accuracy of financial and commercial settlements; tracking the supply chain lifecycle of any component or product; and securely protecting all the transactions and data moving through the supply chain. Blockchains provide an immutable, non-revocable record of all the transactions through the entire supply chain cycle, which will be of great help in the timely resolution of errors or disputes among supply chain partners.  In August, 2016 the World Economic Forum published an excellent report on The future of financial infrastructure, an ambitious look at how blockchain can reshape financial services. The report noted that blockchain technologies have the potential to transform the infrastructure and processes of the financial industry, bringing a diverse range of benefits including operational simplification, near-real time settlements among institutions, more accurate regulatory compliance and liquidity and capital improvements.  However, the report also warned that the evolution towards such a blockchain-based financial infrastructure and processes will take considerable time because it must overcome significant challenges. In particular, it will require the close collaborations of its various stakeholders around the world \u2014 including financial institutions, merchants and governments\u2013to develop the appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks.  This emerging third phase in the evolution of business process transformation is both promising and challenging, as we once more apply IT to make economies more efficient, this time involving the interactions of institutions and industries all around the world.

Oxford Economics, a forecasting and consulting firm, estimates the legislation will contribute 0.4 percentage points to already-robust economic growth in 2018, and another 0.1 to 0.2 points in 2019, said Gregory Daco, head of U.S. economics for the consultancy.  About half of that is likely to come from business spending, and the rest from households, Mr. Daco said. Oxford estimates that each $1 of corporate tax cut will lead to 40 cents of spending, based on historical precedent, Congressional Budget Office studies and conversations with corporate executives.  That\u2019s mostly a one-time gain. A reduction in taxes frees up profits to spend, but that then becomes the new normal, with further growth coming from general economic expansion or other factors.  At Amicus Therapeutics, the new tax law solved a geographic dilemma. The Cranbury, N.J., company is developing an experimental drug to treat Pompe disease, a rare inherited disorder that causes muscle weakness and can be fatal.  After early results for a new drug proved promising, Amicus wanted to increase production for further clinical testing and potential commercial sales.  Amicus, which has been using Chinese contract manufacturer WuXi Biologics to supply the drug, decided in August to build its own facility. The U.S. was at a disadvantage to Europe, due to its 35% statutory federal income-tax rate for companies. Ireland\u2019s corporate tax rate, by contrast, is 12.5%.  Those financial considerations threatened to overshadow other advantages that a U.S. plant would offer, including the ease with which company officials could visit it, and the availability of talented workers in some regions.  \u201cOur strong assumption was that it would be very challenging to establish a new bio-manufacturing facility in the U.S.,\u201d Chief Executive John Crowley said in an interview.  As the tax legislation advanced in Congress last fall, however, building in the U.S. began to look more attractive. On Dec. 21, a day after Congress passed the final measure, which lowered the statutory corporate rate to 21%, Mr. Crowley recommended to his board the company focus on finding a U.S. site. The company has narrowed its choice to three East Coast cities Mr. Crowley declined to identify, and expects to decide in the next month or two. It expects the plant to cost $150 million to $200 million, and to employ at least 200 people at an average pay of $100,000 a year.  Amicus Therapeutics Chief Executive John Crowley, right, chose the U.S. over Europe for a new production facility. Photo: Melissa Golden for The Wall Street Journal  \u201cWith the changes in the tax law, it now makes the U.S. competitive with these geographies we\u2019re looking at,\u201d he said.  The rules of deal making, too, are changing. In the past two months, Aramark completed two acquisitions with a price tag of $2.35 billion as it snapped up hotel procurement and supply firm Avendra in December and uniform-rental and linen-supply firm AmeriPride Services Inc. last week.  Both are a kind of deal that, thanks to the new tax law, has become cheaper. One provision lets companies deduct the cost of buying some sorts of assets immediately, instead of over several years as prior tax law required\u2014and expanded this treatment to used assets as well as new ones.  That essentially lets a buyer like Aramark get an immediate discount on the cash cost of part of its deals, the portion that reflects the acquisition of equipment, machinery and other tangible property.  Aramark\u2019s acquisition of Avendra, a partnership, is automatically treated as an asset purchase, New York tax consultant Robert Willens notes, while deal documents indicate Aramark and AmeriPride agreed to treat that acquisition as an asset purchase as well for tax purposes. (Although the Avendra deal closed in December, the new tax treatment applies to assets acquired after late September.)  \u201cThe cost of deals structured in this manner have taken a turn for the better,\u201d Mr. Willens said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a full 21% discount.\u201d  In news releases, Aramark described its after-tax cost for the two deals as $1.86 billion, 21% less than the pretax price. Aramark said in a statement that it continues to evaluate the impact of the new tax law with accounting firm KPMG LLP, and plans to update investors on the acquisitions when it reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 6.  The same provision, speeding up tax deductions for capital spending, has prompted Kimberly-Clark, the diaper- and tissue-maker, to accelerate at least one major project, CEO Tom Falk said. The company\u2019s board votes next month on a U.S. factory retooling expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. There wasn\u2019t a timeline for the project previously.  \u201cIt gives us more incentive to invest, particularly in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Falk said in an interview. \u201cThe project made sense before the tax benefit. It makes more sense after the tax benefit.\u201d  Similar reconsiderations are under way elsewhere. At United Natural Foods Inc., a grocery distributor with about 10,000 employees and more than $9 billion in annual revenue, the tax law has prompted a wholesale re-evaluation.  Projects previously viewed as risky are being given new consideration, Mike Zechmeister, the company\u2019s finance chief, said in an interview. The return on investment improved by 4 percentage points on a warehousing project in the Pacific region of the U.S. that the company had already decided to pursue, he said, primarily because of the new lower tax rate.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to impact all the decisions we make,\u201d Mr. Zechmeister said. \u201cAlmost all investments look better from an investment standpoint because we won\u2019t have to pay as much tax.\u201d  Grocery distributor United Natural Foods Inc. is investing to overcome capacity bottlenecks. Photo: United Natural Foods  The tax break comes at a particularly good time for United Natural Foods, which has struggled to keep pace with surging demand for natural and organic goods. The company\u2019s net sales rose 8% year-over-year during its last quarter to $2.5 billion, driven largely by Whole Foods, the chain acquired by Amazon.com Inc . last year and United Natural\u2019s biggest customer.  That sudden growth proved costly. The Providence, R.I., company had an additional $25 million in lost sales from out-of-stock goods during its last quarter, along with higher labor costs and storage fees. Any expansion would help ease capacity bottlenecks that the company intends to resolve in coming months.  Some companies are holding pat, either because they want to see how the new rules shake out, or because they are worried about moving too fast.  Verizon said it would use most of its tax savings\u2014$3.5 billion to $4 billion in extra cash in 2018\u2014to pay down some of its $117 billion debt, rather than increase investments. It will also donate to its charity and give employees company stock.  Mr. McAdam, the Verizon CEO, said the wireless giant would remain disciplined about capital spending. \u201cIt\u2019s very inconsistent that just because tax reform comes through, we are all of a sudden going to draw the line at a different place or lose that discipline,\u201d he said on Tuesday.  Several firms have announced plans to plow most of their tax savings into dividends or share repurchases, about a third of which flow to foreign investors, by some estimates.  Bank of America Corp. is exploring how it might invest in branches, technology and its workforce, CEO Brian Moynihan told investors last week. \u201cHowever, to be clear, we\u2019d expect most of the benefits from tax reform will flow to the bottom line through dividends and share buybacks over time,\u201d he added. A spokesman said payouts to shareholders will also help local economies.  The tax overhaul is altering corporate operations in sometimes surprising ways. Netflix Inc., for example, has changed the compensation it will pay three of its top officers, raising their salaries by a combined $19 million.  Its reasoning: The new tax law prevents companies from deducting any sort of pay over $1 million apiece for key executives. Prior law allowed companies to deduct that pay if it was tied to performance. So, having lost the benefit of a tax deduction for paying performance-based bonuses instead of salary, Netflix announced days after the tax law was passed that its board was scrapping the performance measures and converting the pay into straight salary instead, as it used to do before 2014.  The tax-law change is likely to eliminate tax deductions on $92 billion of pay, according to an analysis of Russell 3000 firms by Equilar. Several large companies\u2014including Johnson Controls International PLC and drugmaker AmerisourceBergen Corp. \u2014have said their boards are considering how the tax change affects their approach to compensation. Willis Towers Watson , a compensation-consulting firm, found that 40% of 333 employers it surveyed were either considering executive-pay changes or had already made some.  The ripple effects are hitting small businesses, too. Matthew Wells, president of Western Mechanical Contractors Inc. in Federal Way, Wash., is considering whether to restructure how his business is organized to maximize his benefits under the new tax law.  The 32-person plumbing and mechanical contracting firm is currently set up as an S corporation, a so-called pass-through structure in which the business itself isn\u2019t taxed and its income goes to the owners, who reflect it on their individual tax returns.  Mr. Wells is trying to determine whether his tax bill would fall if he switched to a C corporation, which pays its own income taxes directly to the Internal Revenue Service\u2014now at a 21% rate, down from a top rate of 35% before the new law.  Mr. Wells\u2019 accountant is still poring over the new law, but has suggested the potential benefits may not be as great as the contractor initially believed. \u201cI think they are going to try and talk us out of it,\u201d said Mr. Wells. \u201cBut it is certainly something we are looking into.\u201d  Christmas may be over but WSJ\u2019s Richard Rubin keeps the holiday spirit alive by explaining who\u2019s getting presents and who\u2019s getting coal with the GOP tax bill.  \u2014Sharon Terlep, Ruth Simon and Ryan Knutson contributed to this article.

AbbVie\u2019s (ABBV.N) shares jumped 13.77 percent after the drugmaker significantly boosted its 2018 earnings forecast with help from U.S. tax reform and said it hopes to accelerate dividend growth and share buybacks.  \u201cWe continue to see these positive steps in the right direction and definitely earnings are clearly justifying a lot of the recent move that we\u2019ve had,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Fourth-quarter earnings growth for the S&P 500 is now estimated at 13.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data, up from 12 percent at the start of the year. Of the 133 companies in the index that have reported through Friday, 79.7 percent have topped expectations.  The earnings enabled investors to shrug off a reading on economic growth that came in below expectations.  Gross domestic product increased at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said in its advance GDP report, below the 3-percent forecast, as the strongest pace of consumer spending in three years resulted in a surge in imports.  \u201cYou have manufacturing and the consumer doing well at the same time and the globe is doing better, so that\u2019s a path for future GDP gains, which has always provided a fertile backdrop for earnings gains,\u201d said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management in Milwaukee.

This week, we even had a character \u201cdeath\u201d of one of the \u201croyals\u201d to boot.  For those who have not been paying attention to this epic match, Singapore-domiciled Broadcom has been running a proxy battle with U.S.-based Qualcomm for the past few months, a process that Qualcomm has put enormous efforts into resisting. The two companies are among the most important producers of semiconductors and mobile chipsets, and their combined market value would be in the hundreds of billions of dollars.  Mega-mergers happen occasionally, and hostile takeovers are also not rare. What makes Qualcomm vs. Broadcom unique though is the incredible amount of chess playing that is taking place not only by the two companies, but other companies and governments as well in a simultaneous strategic game for tech domination. Today, I want to highlight a series of those moves from this week, and what those moves portend going forward.  Intel\u2019s nuclear option  Intel is the second largest chipmaker in the world, having recently fallen behind Samsung as Jon Russell noted this January. Intel dominates the chipsets for personal computers, but it has struggled mightily to build an inventory of products targeting smartphones.  That gap has allowed companies like Qualcomm to dominate the market for smartphone chipsets, with recent reports indicating that the company receives 42% of all revenue from the market, with Apple trailing at 20% of the market and MediaTek with 14%. Intel has been barely a blip, which is why it announced just before Mobile World Congress a few weeks ago that it was going to invest heavily in 5G wireless technology going forward.  Today, Qualcomm and Huawei are the technology leaders in the emerging 5G market. While Intel has not executed well in wireless chips in the past, there is a plausible path forward for the company to compete with these two leaders and potentially earn itself a profitable spot at the top of the market.  However, Broadcom\u2019s potential takeover of Qualcomm could vastly complicate such efforts. Broadcom and Qualcomm\u2019s combined market cap could be ahead of Intel\u2019s $244 billion valuation, and if Broadcom were to sell off 5G assets to Huawei (a major point of contention here that is definitely not final), then Intel might have to compete with a deeply-resourced Huawei, a battle it would likely not win.  Intel is gearing up to launch what might be dubbed the nuclear option: a complete buyout of Broadcom. The Wall Street Journal reported on rumors Friday that Intel would take such a move, which would massively dwarf the company\u2019s previous largest acquisition of Altera for $16.7 billion. As the WSJ wrote, \u201cIntel is watching the takeover battle closely and is eager for Broadcom to fail [at acquiring Qualcomm] as the combined company would pose a serious competitive threat, the people said.\u201d  So now we have Intel expending all energy to block Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm, and also Intel considering a pre-emptive, $109 billion (at minimum!) price for Broadcom to prevent the tie-up if it absolutely had to. That\u2019s some very expensive chess moves right there for all of the companies involved.  Singapore, China and the United States enter the fight  Okay, so a company starts to get involved in an M&A process to prevent their competitors from merging and transforming into a more formidable opponent. That\u2019s pretty standard fare, but where the multi-dimensionality of this acquisition war starts to really become visible is the extent to which national governments are intervening to control the outcome.  The United States is doing the most here, through a government committee known as CFIUS, or the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (for those who missed my primer on CFIUS last week, definitely take a read). CFIUS is designed to protect U.S. national security by regulating foreign acquisitions of American companies, and therefore has taken a keen interest in the Broadcom vs. Qualcomm struggle.  In an extraordinarily rare public letter (the committee\u2019s thinking is almost always secret), CFIUS published its preliminary negative outlook on the hostile takeover. Quoting a key paragraph at length:  \u201cReduction in Qualcomm\u2019s long-term technological competitiveness and influence in standard setting would significantly impact U.S. national security. This is in large part because a weakening of Qualcomm\u2019s position would leave an opening for China to expand its influence on the 5G standard-setting process. Chinese companies, including Huawei, have increased their engagement in 5G standardization working groups as part of their efforts to build out a 5G technology. For example, Huawei has increased its R&D expenditures and owns about 10 percent of 5G essential patents. While the United States remains dominant in the standards-setting space currently, China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover. Given well-known U.S. national security concerns about Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies, a shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States.\u201d  Broadcom has been trying to replace most of Qualcomm\u2019s board of directors, with a shareholder vote scheduled for this past week on March 6th. CFIUS asked that the vote be postponed 30 days in order for it to have more time to comprehensively evaluate the national security implications of the proposed transaction.  Originally, I and other analysts thought that CFIUS was responding to pressure from Congress to act unilaterally on the proposed deal. What we have learned though is that Qualcomm\u2019s board had secretly asked CFIUS to review the transaction on January 29th this year.  In other words, Qualcomm is using America\u2019s regulatory authority as a potential weapon to thwart Broadcom\u2019s bid and protect itself. It\u2019s a brilliant maneuver, and also fairly unprecedented: CFIUS is usually only engaged once both parties to a transaction have finalized a deal and submitted it for review.  China has its own regulatory weapon to fight back though. While dealing with the proxy battle with Broadcom, Qualcomm has also been trying to finalize its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, which has been going on for a year now. It raised its offer price two weeks ago to $44 billion, an offer that looks like it is increasingly acceptable to NXP shareholders.  There\u2019s just one hang up: China\u2019s chief regulatory body overseeing the transaction, the Ministry of Commerce or MOFCOM, has yet to approve the deal, and it is the only international trade regulator that hasn\u2019t assented. Some M&A analysts are now saying that the approval process could be extended, not just as a response to CFIUS-related concerns, but also due to Trump\u2019s newly proposed steel and aluminum tariffs.  As I mentioned before, China-based Huawei and Qualcomm are the two market leaders for 5G. Harming Qualcomm then would fundamentally benefit Chinese interest, which is why China is also playing the economic security chess game.  Finally, we get to the Singapore connection. Despite having a majority of its employees and office space in North America according to an NYT Dealbook analysis, Broadcom is domiciled in Singapore, which makes it a foreign company in the eyes of CFIUS. Broadcom has floated a proposal to redomicile to the United States, which would potentially make it exempt from CFIUS (though there is serious debate on this point). CFIUS is clearly worried about losing jurisdiction, because it demanded Broadcom give the committee five business days notice before taking action on redomiciling.  Broadcom is taking action though, since it announced yesterday that it would ask shareholders to approve of a redomicile plan on March 23rd, and it disclosed that it had already discussed the plan with the Singapore courts at a hearing on March 9, which would have to approve the plan. So Singapore also has some regulatory leverage in the game as well, which is all the more complicated since it sits between China and the U.S. on many of the national security issues at the heart of this battle.  The demise of a \u201croyal\u201d and the future  If your head isn\u2019t spinning at all of these dynamics, add in one more: Qualcomm is struggling to overcome a malaise that has hit its share price over the past several years. Qualcomm\u2019s board can\u2019t just ignore Broadcom\u2019s offer, given that the premium being offered today is roughly 50% above its share price from before the proxy battle started.  The Qualcomm board announced this week that executive chairman Paul Jacobs, the former CEO of the company and the son of company founder Irwin Jacobs, would step down and the role eliminated. Jeffrey Henderson, a board director appointed by activist hedge fund Jana Partners, will become chairman of the board. The proxy battle has hit at the heart of the founding family of the company, and is clearly starting to take a more personal toll.  In a battle with so many actors and interests at stake, it is hard to prognosticate on what the outcome here is going to be. My analysis is that the Trump administration is going to attempt to maintain jurisdiction over the merger regardless of Broadcom\u2019s redomicile process, and will likely end up negative on the deal although it may not outright block it. Qualcomm also seems increasingly warm to offers from Broadcom to buy the company, and Qualcomm\u2019s desire to consummate a deal would certainly move the process more quickly forward.  Expect more hijinks and chess moves in the coming weeks as the final stages of this fight reach their crescendo. The season finale of this battle is still far away.", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-10", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/03/10/qualcomm-vs-broadcom/"}, {"article": "There\u2019s a new venture fund in town from some familiar faces.

The Korean tech giant\u2019s sales in 2017 were enough to see it unseat Intel as the world\u2019s largest chipmaker based on revenue \u2014 ending Intel\u2019s 25-year run at the top \u2014 and, while Samsung doesn\u2019t break down its sources of revenue in the guidance, you\u2019d imagine that chips are again the main revenue driver.  Samsung is forecasting that its Q1 profit could hit 15.6 trillion KRW ($14.7 billion) up 19 percent year-on-year and well above the 14.5 trillion that analysts polled by Reuters had predicted. Indeed, that figure would represent a record profit for the first quarter of the financial year for Samsung.  Total sales for the quarter are estimated at 60 trillion KRW (or approximately $56.1 billion), which would be down on the previous quarter (which includes the festive period) but up on the 50.55 trillion total it reported in Q1 2017.  Still though, there\u2019s some concern that the popularity of the iPhone X may be causing slow sales of Samsung\u2019s flagship Galaxy S9 smartphone. Samsung won\u2019t give details on that until it releases its full results for the quarter later in April, but for now it appears that demand for its memory chips is offsetting any disappointment in the consumer smartphone space, despite some concerns around memory price stability.  \u201cDemand for servers canceled out the effect of slow sales for iPhone X and premium Chinese smartphones. Demand is exceeding market expectations,\u201d KTB Investment & Securities analyst Kim Yang-jae said according to Bloomberg.  The Q1 earnings will be Samsung\u2019s first since Jay Y. Lee, vice chairman and the company\u2019s heir apparent, was released from jail after his bribery sentence was suspended.

And espionage concerns have for years kept Huawei \u2014 one of the world\u2019s biggest suppliers of telecom gear, and a powerhouse of China\u2019s tech scene \u2014 largely out of the American market.  Photo  The Trump administration says it wants to level the playing field, dishing out to Chinese companies the kind of treatment that American ones have been receiving in China for some time.  \u201cChina\u2019s abilities and ambitions have shifted much further up the value-added chain, to tech that represents our crown jewels economically and that is relevant for national security,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cSo there\u2019s no way to kick this can down the road anymore.\u201d  Still, as much as American companies complain about how they are treated in China, it could get even worse if Beijing amplifies its retaliation beyond the tariffs, announced Friday, on $3 billion worth of goods.  China could require that foreign tech companies undergo costly additional tests for new products, or simply make it more difficult to operate in the country. Apple, whose iPhones remain coveted among well-off Chinese, made nearly $18 billion in the country in the last quarter of 2017. Qualcomm, the San Diego microchip maker, has earned half its revenue in China in recent years.  It could also devise new regulatory hoops for foreign companies to jump through. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce has not yet approved Qualcomm\u2019s proposed, $44 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors, a Dutch chip maker. The deal, more than a year in the making, needs a signoff from Chinese antitrust authorities because the two companies count a large number of electronics makers in China as customers.  Both countries\u2019 efforts to kneecap each other\u2019s tech champions are as much about national security as economic might. Likewise with the race to dominate frontier fields such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and next-generation wireless internet. Mr. Trump recently blocked a hostile bid by Broadcom to buy Qualcomm. He did so not because the bidder was Chinese \u2014 Broadcom is headquartered in Singapore \u2014 but because the administration said the deal would weaken Qualcomm, leaving Huawei with a stronger hand to shape 5G, or fifth-generation mobile technology.

The Soviet Union was a tech rival in defense, though a laggard in the commercial sphere.

For most of the past decade, Beijing has blocked many American internet services, including Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s, to control the flow of information and head off social media-fueled movements such as the Arab Spring.  Another great paroxysm of worry came in 2013, when Edward J. Snowden leaked documents showing ties between American technology providers and the National Security Agency\u2019s vast surveillance program.  For China, \u201cone of the major takeaways was, \u2018We are overly reliant on American technology over which we have very little control,\u2019\u201d said Rogier Creemers, a scholar of Chinese tech policy at Leiden University in the Netherlands.  A Communist Party-linked newsmagazine singled out the American companies that it said had penetrated most deeply into China\u2019s information infrastructure. The \u201cEight Guardian Warriors,\u201d as they were called \u2014 Apple, Cisco, Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle and Qualcomm \u2014 had been able to \u201cdrive right into China,\u201d the article said, whereas Huawei and another Chinese equipment maker, ZTE, had been kept out of the United States.  Beijing swung into action. It banned government offices from installing the most recent version of Microsoft Windows, and antitrust investigators raided Microsoft\u2019s offices. Cisco, Apple and Intel products were removed from state lists that officials use as guides when buying equipment. Qualcomm got slapped with a $975 million fine for anticompetitive behavior.  The political pressure sent American companies scrambling to link up with Chinese partners, leading to joint ventures of the sort that the Trump administration, and some in the American business community, have decried as unfair.

Microsoft, in conjunction with a state company closely tied to the Chinese military, developed a version of Windows more suitable for China\u2019s government. Advanced Micro Devices, Intel and Qualcomm began working with Chinese organizations in microchips, which China imports in huge quantities to put into smartphones, computers and other electronics.

But most observers believe that it is only a matter of time before Chinese factories catch up to those at industry leaders in the United States, South Korea and Taiwan.  \u201cThey are very conscious that they still have a long way to go,\u201d said Dieter Ernst, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, a research and educational organization based in Honolulu. \u201cBut they also know that in semiconductors, they are by far the most important market for American companies.\u201d  One stumbling block for China: Attempts to scoop up foreign chip makers mostly have not worked out. State-owned Tsinghua Unigroup tried to buy Micron Technology, a memory chip maker based in Idaho, for $23 billion in 2015, but regulatory worries scuttled the deal.  The Trump administration last year blocked a China-backed investor from buying Lattice Semiconductor, an Oregon-based manufacturer. And regulatory concerns scotched a Chinese investment group\u2019s plan to buy Xcerra, even though the Massachusetts-based company makes chip-testing equipment and not chips themselves.  In Washington, concern about the emerging rivalry with China has been reflected in a number of recent reports, from the likes of the Pentagon and the Department of Energy, that warn about the country\u2019s growing tech capabilities. Still, shorter-term considerations could mean that Washington would back down before Beijing in an all-out trade war.  \u201cIf the markets take a nose-dive as we move closer to the midterm elections,\u201d Mr. Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said, \u201cthat would put some pressure on Trump to look for face-saving solutions, even if final problems haven\u2019t been addressed.\u201d", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-23", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/technology/trump-china-tariffs-tech-cold-war.html"}, {"article": "The issue repeatedly flared without resolution under the Obama administration, peaking in 2016, when the government tried to force Apple to help it break into the iPhone of one of the attackers in the terrorist assault in San Bernardino, Calif.  The debate receded when the Trump administration took office, but in recent months top officials like Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, and Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, have begun talking publicly about the \u201cgoing dark\u201d problem.  The National Security Council and the Justice Department declined to comment about the internal deliberations. The people familiar with the talks spoke on the condition of anonymity, cautioning that they were at a preliminary stage and that no request for legislation was imminent.  But the renewed push is certain to be met with resistance.  \u201cBuilding an exceptional access system is a complicated engineering problem with many parts that all have to work perfectly in order for it to be secure, and no one has a solution to it,\u201d said Susan Landau, a Tufts University computer security professor. \u201cAny of the options people are talking about now would heighten the danger that your phone or your laptop could be hacked and data taken off of it.\u201d  Craig Federighi, the senior vice president of software engineering at Apple, stressed the importance of strengthening \u2014 not weakening \u2014 security protections for products like the iPhone, saying threats to data security were increasing every day and arguing that it was a question of \u201csecurity versus security\u201d rather than security versus privacy.  \u201cProposals that involve giving the keys to customers\u2019 device data to anyone but the customer inject new and dangerous weaknesses into product security,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWeakening security makes no sense when you consider that customers rely on our products to keep their personal information safe, run their businesses or even manage vital infrastructure like power grids and transportation systems.\u201d  But some computer security researchers believe the problem might be solvable with an acceptable level of new risks.

While it largely described challenges to solving the problem, one section cited presentations by several technologists who are developing potential approaches.  They included Ray Ozzie, a former chief software architect at Microsoft; Stefan Savage, a computer science professor at the University of California, San Diego; and Ernie Brickell, a former chief security officer at Intel.  Photo  According to several people familiar with the new round of deliberations, those three men have been participating in a series of workshops convened at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Daniel Weitzner, a computer science professor. They have discussed their research with government officials, including Valerie Cofield, a senior F.B.I. science and technology official working on \u201cgoing dark\u201d issues.  The researchers, Mr. Ozzie said, recognized that \u201cthis issue is not going away,\u201d and were trying to foster \u201cconstructive dialogue\u201d rather than declaring that no solution is possible.  Mr. Savage said the talks had focused on trying to create a safe enough way to unlock data on encrypted devices, as opposed to the separate matter of decoding intercepted messages sent via encrypted communications services, like Signal and WhatsApp.  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Data in motion and the cloud are much harder to deal with.\u201d  The deliberations shed new light on public remarks by Trump administration officials in recent months. In October, Mr. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, argued in a speech that permitting technology companies to create \u201cwarrant-proof encryption\u201d was endangering society.  \u201cTechnology companies almost certainly will not develop responsible encryption if left to their own devices,\u201d he said. \u201cCompetition will fuel a mind-set that leads them to produce products that are more and more impregnable. That will give criminals and terrorists more opportunities to cause harm with impunity.\u201d  And Mr. Wray, the F.B.I. director, has twice given speeches this year in which he pointed to Symphony, an encrypted messaging system for banks. Pushed by a state regulator, several banks agreed to give copies of their Symphony keys to law firms. Because Symphony keeps a copy of encrypted data on its servers, that arrangement created a backup means for investigators to gain access to the messages if necessary.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cAt the end, the data in Symphony was still secure, still encrypted, but also accessible to the regulators so they could do their jobs,\u201d Mr. Wray told a cybersecurity conference in Boston this month. \u201cI\u2019m confident that by working together and finding similar areas to agree and compromise, we can come up with solutions to the \u2018going dark\u2019 problem.\u201d  The Symphony approach, however, would not work for millions of ordinary smartphone users. But one alternative being worked on by Mr. Ozzie and others is receiving particular attention inside the government.  The idea is that when devices encrypt themselves, they would generate a special access key that could unlock their data without the owner\u2019s passcode. This electronic key would be stored on the device itself, inside part of its hard drive that would be separately encrypted \u2014 so that only the manufacturer, in response to a court order, could open it.  Law enforcement officials see that idea as attractive in part because companies like Apple are already trusted to securely hold special keys permitting them to push operating system updates to devices like iPhones.  Still, Ms. Landau argued that creating such a system would create significant additional security risks. She noted, among other things, that updates are relatively rare but police would want seized phones opened every day \u2014 so many more tech company employees would need access to the powerful new keys, increasing the risk of theft or abuse.  The Obama administration never agreed on asking for legislation mandating access mechanisms. Military and cybersecurity agencies worried that weakening security would create new problems, and commerce officials worried about quashing innovation and making American tech products less competitive.  Still, in 2016, the Obama administration\u2019s deliberations also came to focus on the idea of access keys on devices, a participant said, but stalled because of difficult technical questions about the details. They included how to prevent criminals from deleting the access keys on their devices or from using phones that do not have the mechanism because they run on outdated software or were built for foreign markets.  But one Justice Department official familiar with the deliberations contended that it might not be necessary to come up with a foolproof system, arguing that a solution that would work for ordinary, less-savvy criminals was still worth pursuing.  Mr. Brickell, the former Intel official, echoed that view. Enforcing compliance with a rule that devices must have access mechanisms to function \u201cis a difficult problem,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working on it.

Intel unleashed unbelievably fast Optane 900P SSDs earlier this year but, to our chagrin, they\u2019re not exactly affordable at $369 (\u00a3329, AU$559) for the smallest, 280GB drive. Not to mention 900P drives don\u2019t come in the easy-to-install and ubiquitous M.2 form factor \u2013 instead, they\u2019ve only been available as a beefy PCIe card or U.2 drive.  So, enter the Intel Optane SSD 800P drives. These drives pack the same 3D XPoint technology that makes the 900P series so blazing fast into a far smaller package. Plus, these gum stick-sized SSDs start at a more affordable price, albeit with much, much smaller capacities, with 58GB running for $129 (about \u00a390, AU$165) and $199 (about \u00a3140, AU$255) for 118GB.  While these drives should be just as fast as the company\u2019s flagship enterprise drives, poor decisions to limit its maximum bandwidth, capacity and performance \u2013 no to mention a still high asking price \u2013 make them hard recommend for anyone.  Features  Whereas the Intel Optane SSD 900P was introduced as a high-end storage solution, the Intel Optane SSD 800P was announced as mainstream storage for use as a primary \u2013 or operating system boot \u2013 drive.  However, we find it tough see ourselves using a 58GB SSD as our main drive. Even if we were to RAID two 118GB drives together for a total of 236GB, it seems puny compared to the other 256GB SSDs we could pick up for half the price and far less complexity.  The Intel Optane SSD 800P\u2019s headline feature should be 3D XPoint, which is designed to deliver 1,000 times the performance, 1,000 times the speed, and 10 times the capacity of traditional NAND.  Unfortunately, the tiny capacities in which you can buy an Optane SSD 800P don\u2019t really support Intel\u2019s claims. Speed-wise, these drives are also limited by a PCIe 3.0 x 2 interface that can only achieve up to 1,450MB/s and 640MB/s sequential read and write speeds, respectively.  That\u2019s half as slow as the speeds we see from other mainstream NVMe drives, such as the Samsung 960 Evo or Intel\u2019s own 760p Series SSD .  Image 1 of 6 Image 2 of 6 Image 3 of 6 Image 4 of 6 Image 5 of 6 Image 6 of 6  Performance  In our standard battery of storage benchmarks, the Optane SSD 800P falters behind many other drives. Unsurprisingly, the drive\u2019s sequential read and write speeds are half of other drives utilizing PCIe 3.0 x 4 interface. This leaves us to conclude there\u2019s an intrinsic connection between the halved performance and using only half as many PCIe lanes.  Surprisingly, the Intel Optane SSD 800P achieves some of the best random write speeds we\u2019ve seen, though, once again random read performance leaves us wanting.  Intel claims that its newest mainstream drive is most effective at operating with low queue depth. (If you\u2019ve never heard of the phrase before, queue depth refers to the number of read or write operations a volume of storage can handle at the same time.)  However, our simple file transfer tests show that this really isn\u2019t the case. The Intel Optane SSD 800P takes almost the longest to complete a 10GB file transfer compared against Intel Optane SSD 900P, Intel 760p and Samsung 960 Evo. It fares better when moving a 10GB folder, but you\u2019re still looking at paying much more for this drive that doesn\u2019t perform significantly better.  Final verdict  In the end, we\u2019re at a loss as to who the Intel Optane SSD 800P would be ideal for. To even get a decent amount of storage, you would have to buy two 118GB drives for $199 (about \u00a3140, AU$255) each \u2013 then go through the trouble of arranging them into a RAID.  Meanwhile, most \u2018mainstream\u2019 users would get more storage, a cheaper price and better performance by going with a 256GB Intel 760p Series SSD for $109 (\u00a3113, AU$169) or 250GB Samsung 960 Evo for $119 (\u00a3129, AU$189).

This year, the Hades Canyon NUC represents a partnership between Intel and AMD we would have never expected \u2013 or even fathomed.  It\u2019s easily the smallest VR-capable PC that marries together an Intel quad-core processor with integrated, \u2018discrete-class\u2019 AMD Radeon RX Vega graphics into a single chip. With all that power under its belt, this gaming PC easily smashes through Full HD gaming with most modern titles and performs like a productivity champ.  Despite all the caveats of that comes with a barebones computer such as this, the Intel Hades Canyon NUC earns top marks for packing so much performance into a small package. It\u2019s one of the best and our favorite mini PC of the year so far.  Spec Sheet Here is the Intel Hades Canyon NUC configuration sent to TechRadar for review: CPU: 3.1GHz Intel Core i7-8809G (quad-core, 8MB Cache, up to 4.2GHz)  Graphics: Radeon RX Vega M GH graphics (4GB HBM2 VRAM), Intel UHD Graphics 630  RAM: Kingston HyperX 16GB DDR4 (3,200MHz)  Storage: 118GB Intel Optane SSD 800P Series (NVMe), 512GB Intel SSD 545s Series (M.2 SATA)  Ports (front): 1 x USB-C 3.1 Gen 2, 1 x USB-A 3.1 Gen 2, 1 x USB-A 3.1 Gen 1, SD card reader, HDMI 2.0a  Ports (rear): 2 x Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C), 4 x USB 3.0, HDMI 2.0a, 2 x mini DisplayPort, 2 x Ethernet, optical audio out  Connectivity: Intel Wireless-AC 8265, Bluetooth 4.2  Weight: 2 pounds (0.91kg)  Size: 8.7 x 5.6 x 1.54 inches (22.1 x 14.2 x 3.9cm; W x D x H)  Price and availability  Our particular Intel Hades Canyon NUC8i7HVK review unit costs $999 (about \u00a3710, AU$1,302), which is about half-to-a-third off the price of an equally competent gaming laptop . Not too shabby for a PC equipped with a quad-core Intel Core i7 and nearly Nvidia GTX 1060 equivalent graphics.  That said, this barebones unit doesn\u2019t come with storage, memory or an operating system, so you\u2019ll have to get those pieces on your own.  There\u2019s also an entry-level Intel Hades Canyon NUC8i7HNK priced at $799 (about \u00a3570, AU$1,040). This more affordable NUC comes still comes with a quad-core i7 CPU, but it maxes out at a slower frequency. Meanwhile, the onboard Radeon RX Vega M GL GPU has four fewer compute units and won\u2019t run as fast either.  Compared to other barebone PCs, the high-end Intel Hades Canyon NUC compares well against the $949 (\u00a3619, AU$1,739) Zotac Zbox Magnus EN1060K and $999 (\u00a3819, AU$1,579) Gigabyte Brix GB-BNi7HG6-1060. Both of these mini PCs feature older Kaby Lake processors but a Nvidia GTX 1060 with two more GB of video RAM and higher CUDA  Image 1 of 6 Image 2 of 6 Image 3 of 6 Image 4 of 6 Image 5 of 6 Image 6 of 6  Design  At first blush, the Hades Canyon NUC looks more like a set top box than a desktop PC, and that\u2019s honestly a good thing. The device is interesting enough to look like more than just a plain box in your home entertainment setup while also not being too distracting if you decide to use it as your work computer.  If you remember the Skull Canyon NUC Intel released two years prior, the Hades Canyon should look very familiar. Both units share the same overall shape, plus an identical hexagonal motif for the ventilation holes and top panel. Of course, with the integration of \u2018discrete-class\u2019 graphics and sufficient cooling to back it up, Intel\u2019s flagship NUC is almost twice as large as its predecessor.  Intel\u2019s design has also seen some improvements. The old interchangeable plastic panels have been replaced by a much slicker light-up skull fashioned after the silicon that resides within. The lighting on this part of the case and all the little hard drive and power indicators are fully customizable \u2013 or you could just turn them all off for a stealthy unit.  Despite this PC\u2019s small size, it packs an impressive amount of ports. Along the backside alone you\u2019ll find four USB 3.0 ports, two ThunderBolt 3 ports, two mini DisplayPorts, HDMI 2.0 and even two Gigabit Ethernet ports. That\u2019s more connectivity than you\u2019ll even find on some full-size desktops.  Cracking open the Hades Canyon NUC is a breeze, as it just requires undoing six torx screws and a single Philips head. With the top cover removed, you can access the computer\u2019s memory slots as well as the M.2 NVMe and SATA drives.

We can play all our favorite games, including Far Cry 5 and Warhammer: Vermintide 2, at a steady 60 frames per second (fps) with high-quality graphical settings and a 1080p resolution.  Even more impressive is that the little PC holds it own through Overwatch and Hitman at 1440p with HDR active on a Samsung CHG70 QLED gaming monitor. The only title to give us some measurable difficulty is Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins, but it still runs at a completely playable 40fps with high quality settings and a 1080p resolution.  Outside of gaming, the Intel Hades Canyon NUC runs like a champ through all our regular web browsing and word processing, as well as our image and video editing needs. For those multi-monitor fans, the Intel Hades Canyon NUC can also drive up to six screens.  Compared to comparable notebook hardware in the 15-inch Microsoft Surface Book 2 , the Intel NUC almost wins the complete race in both processor and graphically intensive tests. A full-on gaming laptop like the Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming manages to close the gap a little better, but for the most part the Hades Canyon stays on top.  Meanwhile, a gaming PC with actual desktop parts, like the Asus ROG G20CI , proves to be tougher competition. While the NUC manages to score better in the processor tests, the integrated graphics just can\u2019t keep up with a Nvidia GTX 1080 \u2013 then again, neither could the AMD Radeon RX Vega 64 .  Final verdict  The Intel Hades Canyon NUC is the company\u2019s most impressive mini PC yet, capable of playing most modern games with ease and offering plenty of performance for everyday computing. And, that\u2019s all without the help of an external GPU, unlike the previous Skull Canyon NUC.  This is true high-end desktop computing on a single, standalone chip. Beyond this one device, it represents a turning point for thin-and-light laptops like HP Spectre x360 15 and Dell XPS 15 2-in-1 to be just as powerful as full-on gaming laptops  Although the Hades Canyon NUC might be expensive and require additional parts, you won\u2019t find another mini PC as powerful as this. The expansive array of ports and support for high-end internal components is equally as amazing. Thanks to its small size, it's also the perfect home theater PC.  All in all, Intel has produced an incredibly tiny and VR-capable gaming PC worthy of your attention and consideration.", "stock": "INTC", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/reviews/intel-hades-canyon-nuc"}, {"article": "On top of announcing the first Intel Core i9 processors, the chip-maker took to filling out the rest of its Coffee Lake desktop CPU line.

The official supplier for the games is Japanese operator NTT DoCoMo, which plans to launch a commercial 5G network in 2020.  Also speaking at MWC, NTT DoCoMo CEO Kazuhiro Yoshizawa said its plans for 5G were well underway and it was confident that 5G could help create new services and tackle social issues. The Olympics could be the killer app that convinces people they need the faster speeds, lower latency and higher capacity that 5G affords.  \u201cMany people questioned the necessity when we introduced 3G and 4G but as it turns out, the adoption of social media and streaming expanded rapidly to become a \u2018must have\u2019 for many people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said.  \u201cBack then the network rolled out first and services came out late.

Both VideoCardz and WccfTech have found evidence of octa-core Intel Coffee Lake S processors slated for post-June release.  Reportedly uncovered through leaks in benchmarking software maker Futuremark\u2019s 3DMark database, not much is known about these processors beyond base clock speeds, which could change, and the vastly more important core count. If all pans out, you\u2019re looking at Intel Coffee Lake S processors capable of driving eight cores at a 2.2GHz frequency with what appears to be a 16MB cache.  Of course, neither the processor\u2019s test scores nor more specific information is available at this time. Regardless, this is an excellent sign of Intel\u2019s intent to compete with AMD in the high-end mainstream processor space for gamers and other hobbyist consumers with money to burn.  Intel\u2019s no stranger to the core craze, but in mainstream?  Last year, we definitely saw Intel release an 18-core beast of a processor in the Core i9-7980XE , but that was based on Intel\u2019s larger 22nm architecture, as well as its X299 chipset and motherboard series, and cost nearly thousands.  On its more modern 14nm process, Intel was only able to get as far as hexa-core processors in 2017, led by the award-winning, Z370-based Core i7-8700K for more than a thousand less. While that was able to trounce AMD Ryzen \u2019s best in our tests, Intel clearly isn\u2019t about to let that momentum die out.  That\u2019s what makes this finding so significant, that octa-core Intel processors are within reach of prospective PC builders for prices that, while still exorbitant, aren\u2019t prohibitively so. However, it's expected that these new processors will be compatible only with the upcoming Intel Z390, also featured within this database leak \u2013 so it'll likely be a bit pricier to get in on these processors than just the cost of the chip.

At the time, they were billed as an evolution of the previous, 7th-generation chips, bringing quad-core designs to the i5 line and therefore more power.  However, these chips have also been said to boost efficiency when it comes to power consumption.  That said, let\u2019s say you\u2019re at the local computer store. In an aisle littered with choices, you\u2019ve narrowed it down to one laptop, but there are two models side-by-side. One is housing an Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake (last year\u2019s 7th-generation) processor, and another a Core i7 Kaby Lake R (this year\u2019s 8th-generation).  With the chance to save, say, $100 (or \u00a3100) in this case, how much more would you really be getting out of that most up-to-date model to make that extra cost worthwhile?  We\u2019ve tested this real-life dilemma with three versions of the same Acer Swift 3 laptop \u2013 one with a 7th-gen Intel Core i5, one with an 8th-gen Intel Core i5 and one with that same chip and Nvidia MX150 graphics installed \u2013 to demonstrate.  As it turns out, the differences are rather striking in some areas and rather negligible in others.  Performance Benchmarks PCMark 8 Home  7th-gen Core i5: 2,791  8th-gen Core i5: 3,278  8th-gen Core i5 (MX150): 3,203 Geekbench 4  7th-gen Core i5: 3,911 Single-Core; 7,654 Multi-Core  8th-gen Core i5: 4,168 Single-Core; 14,009 Multi-Core  8th-gen Core i5 (MX150): 3,994 Single-Core; 13,557 Multi-Core Cinebench  7th-gen Core i5: 327 CPU; 49 Graphics  8th-gen Core i5: 530 CPU; 52 Graphics  8th-gen Core i5 (MX150): 512 CPU; 90 Graphics CPU-Z  7th-gen Core i5: 324.3 Single-Thread; 925.8 Multi-Thread  8th-gen Core i5: 402.7 Single-Thread; 1993.2 Multi-Thread  8th-gen Core i5 (MX150): 397.4 Single-Thread; 1928.4 Multi-Thread  Performance  When it comes to pure computing power output, there\u2019s little doubt that the 8th generation of Intel Core is stronger than the 7th. For instance, we see here that the 8th gen all but spanks the previous in Geekbench 4\u2019s multi-core CPU test.  The same is made obvious by our Cinebench and CPU-Z benchmark results: the leap from dual-core in the 7th generation to quad-core in the 8th generation is enormous.  In practical use, an 8th-gen machine will render multiple streams of data far faster than the previous generation, so expect smoother video and complex image editing from such a device.  However, we\u2019ve noticed interesting differences between the 8th-gen model without Nvidia graphics and the one that\u2019s housing an MX150 graphics chip.  In almost all of these aforementioned tests, the model without dedicated graphics outperformed the one with Nvidia graphics.  According to Intel, these differences amount to \u2018unit-to-unit variations\u2019 within a margin of error of 2% to 3%.  All in all, we\u2019re seeing a 17% (in PCMark 8 Home) to an 83% (in Geekbench 4) to as much as a 115% (in CPU-Z) increase in throughput between generations. That\u2019s certainly nothing to scoff at for a difference in price of 100 to 200 bills.  Battery Benchmarks PCMark 8 Battery Life  7th-gen Core i5: 4 hours and 25 minutes  8th-gen Core i5: 4 hours and 26 minutes  8th-gen Core i5 (MX150): 4 hours and 14 minutes TechRadar Battery Test  7th-gen Core i5: 6 hours and 58 minutes  8th-gen Core i5: 7 hours and 25 minutes  8th-gen Core i5 (MX150): 7 hours and 32 minutes  Battery life  That said, when it comes to longevity, the latest Intel processors don\u2019t enjoy nearly as incredible of an increase, but it\u2019s at least a boost. In short, don\u2019t expect all-day battery life just because you splurged on the model with the latest processor.  In the PCMark 8 Battery Life test, we\u2019re seeing gains so small that they\u2019re within the margin of error (and proof that dedicated graphics a long-lasting laptop does not make).  In our local video playback test, however, the 8th-gen model lasted nearly 30 minutes longer, while the one with Nvidia graphics lasted more than 30 minutes longer.  Of course, Intel never made a big stink about increases in lasting power when it rolled out Kaby Lake R late last year.  Just don\u2019t splurge on an 8th-generation Intel Core processor within a laptop model versus one with the previous version on account of battery life solely.  So, how much better is Kaby Lake R?  Unsurprisingly, 8th-generation Intel Core, or Kaby Lake R, is better than the previous generation Intel Core processors by just about every measure. However, those improvements come in varying levels of magnitude, with battery life gains being the smallest.  It\u2019s difficult for us to say that you\u2019re going to be massively rewarded for spending that extra scratch to get the latest-and-greatest, 8th-gen version of a given laptop you\u2019ve been eying. Frankly, because you\u2019re not: in real-world use, and for most users, you\u2019re not going to see a world of difference.  But, for those who work in rendering video or complex imagery with layers a la Photoshop, it most definitely pays to go quad-core if you can swing it.

Qualcomm and Apple have been in a bitter licensing dispute and Apple lately has switched to Intel chips in a portion of its devices. Should Broadcom succeed in buying Qualcomm, it could smooth over relations with Apple, closing a door to further possible gains from Intel.  A Broadcom deal would be Intel\u2019s biggest acquisition by far\u2014and should it pursue one, there is no guarantee regulators would bless it. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., and with a market value of nearly $240 billion, has been acquisitive in recent years as it looks to diversify away from its core business of powering the personal-computer industry, which is in decline.  Last year, Intel bought Israeli car-camera pioneer Mobileye NV for roughly $15.3 billion in a bet on connected cars. In 2015, it struck its largest deal ever when it bought Altera Corp. for $16.7 billion. Intel hoped that buying Altera, a maker of programmable chips, would help bolster its position in server systems and other equipment found in data centers and telecommunications networks, the company said at the time, as well as fuel its plans surrounding the so-called Internet of Things.  In the most recent piece of drama surrounding Broadcom\u2019s bid to buy Qualcomm, the effort was dealt a setback when the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, indicated it has concerns about the takeover and would review it.  That appeared to lengthen the odds that Broadcom and its chief executive, Hock Tan, would succeed in their pursuit of Qualcomm, which has rejected the $117 billion offer as too low.  Separately, Qualcomm has in place its own pending $44 billion deal to buy NXP Semiconductors NV, which it sweetened in February, a move Broadcom criticized.  Qualcomm and Broadcom unleashed dueling announcements Friday as each sought to win support from regulators and shareholders during the takeover fight.  Qualcomm, looking to assert its board\u2019s independence, said Paul Jacobs would no longer be executive chairman. Mr. Jacobs, the son of Qualcomm co-founder Irwin Jacobs, will remain on the board. Current board member Jeffrey Henderson was named nonexecutive chairman.  Broadcom has been seeking to replace a majority of Qualcomm\u2019s board members to help pave the way for a deal. A vote on the directors that was slated to take place this past Tuesday at Qualcomm\u2019s annual meeting was pushed back a month at CFIUS\u2019s behest.  Broadcom, meanwhile, pledged that if it succeeds in acquiring its target, it wouldn\u2019t sell \u201cany critical national security assets to any foreign companies.\u201d The assurance was a nod to U.S. concerns that a takeover could weaken Qualcomm\u2019s position\u2014and therefore the country\u2019s standing\u2014as a leader in developing next-generation 5G cellular technology.  Broadcom late Friday said it will ask shareholders to vote March 23 to approve the company\u2019s plan to redomicile from Singapore to the U.S., potentially setting the stage for a showdown with CFIUS as the vote would take place in the middle of the panel\u2019s review of Broadcom\u2019s bid.  If Broadcom were considered a U.S. company, its acquisition would arguably fall outside of the panel\u2019s jurisdiction, though CFIUS could say it still has jurisdiction to review the bid since it began the review while Broadcom was a Singapore company.  Should Broadcom fail in its bid for Qualcomm, it is possible Intel would stand down, happy with the status quo.  Underlying the maneuvering is a battle among chip companies to be the chief supplier of critical cellular components to smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung Electronics Co.  Qualcomm is a leader in chips that run apps and manage cellular communications in smartphones. It competes with Broadcom in chips for short-range wireless networking, including Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and radio filters and other chips that condition cellular signals.  Intel, which dominates the market for the calculating engines in personal computers and data-center servers, missed the mobile revolution when its chips proved too power-hungry for battery-dependent cellphones. But Intel\u2019s cellular communications chips lately have displaced Qualcomm\u2019s in a portion of Apple\u2019s iPhones, and the company has been moving aggressively to develop that product line.  Acquiring Broadcom would give Intel a suite of smartphone chips, adding to its own communications chips the Singapore-based company\u2019s radio filters as well as Bluetooth and GPS components.  Broadcom sells a diverse line of equipment for networking and communications\u2014including technology for smartphones from Apple and Samsung\u2014as well as data storage, electronic displays and set-top boxes. Broadcom, like Qualcomm, is a so-called fabless chip company, designing processors while relying on manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to actually make them.  Under Mr. Tan, Broadcom has pursued a string of acquisitions. The company was formed when Avago Technologies Ltd. in 2015 agreed to buy the former Broadcom for roughly $37 billion and kept its name. Broadcom\u2019s revenue was twice the size of Avago\u2019s at the time of the merger.

It was cleverly spun. Mr. Boyd played up the access to the secondary information Mr. Nunes had demanded\u2014access to the application and renewals for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants on one-time Trump associate Carter Page. Mr. Boyd describes his department\u2019s response as \u201cextraordinary accommodation.\u201d  Upon inspection, however, the focus on the FISA warrants looks more like an effort to distract attention from Mr. Boyd\u2019s refusal even to mention Mr. Nunes\u2019s main request of FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. That request was for the \u201celectronic communication,\u201d or memo, that officially launched the counterintelligence investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.  On Friday Trey Gowdy, an Intel Committee member who has seen a redacted form of the memo, said Justice has redacted the \u201cgood stuff.\u201d He means information that would tell whether the counterintelligence investigation was credible, and how and whether the FBI vetted the information. \u201cAll of that,\u201d Mr. Gowdy said, \u201cis in a paragraph I can\u2019t read.\u201d  Justice says the blacked-out paragraph can\u2019t be shared with Congress because it identifies a foreign country that shares intelligence with the U.S. This is a hard argument to credit, given that in December someone told the New York Times that Australian diplomat Alexander Downer was the source for the information that minor Trump campaign official George Papadopoulos had bragged about Russian dirt on Hillary Clinton. In February former CIA Director John Brennan referred to the FBI\u2019s relationship with British intelligence when asked about the information on Mr. Papadopoulos.  Mr. Nunes needs this information because it is crucial to understanding whether Justice and the FBI had good reason to launch this investigation\u2014and how they handled it. The Papadopoulos narrative matters to the FBI, because attributing the launch of the investigation to him minimizes the role of the now infamous Steele dossier.  Some suspect that the real reason Justice is keeping this paragraph secret is because it might reveal embarrassing facts about how the Papadopoulos information was used. This might include a role for political actors (rather than intelligence officials) in ginning up the Trump-Russia investigation.  Meanwhile, on Saturday President Trump asked in a tweet what \u201cJustice and the FBI have to hide\u201d? He added, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they giving the strongly requested documents (unredacted) to the HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE?\u201d\u2014which has subpoenaed similar information about FBI actions during the 2016 election.  The President might ask the same about the stonewalling of the Intel Committee. Do Mr. Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions think that ignoring the committee\u2019s main request is in the spirit of the \u201cextraordinary accommodation\u201d that Mr. Boyd claims?

The purchase of Regency Outdoor Advertising, if successful, would be the largest yet for the fast-growing Silicon Valley streaming video company, which has a studio in Hollywood and is now one of the world\u2019s biggest film and TV producers.  Netflix\u2019s motivation was not immediately clear, but it could save money over time with the deal, according to industry analysts, as it ramps up spending on marketing for its original shows and movies to $2 billion this year. Netflix used Regency Outdoor billboards to promote its \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown\u201d drama series.  A billboard ad on Los Angeles\u2019s Sunset Strip can cost $140,000 per month, said Barry Lowenthal, president of The Media Kitchen, a New York-based media buyer.  \u201cThis is a smart move for Netflix because it is a very important viewing market,\u201d Lowenthal said. \u201cLos Angeles matters to the people in the industry.\u201d  Tech firms Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Hulu and Facebook Inc (FB.O) and traditional media companies such as Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) are all vying with Netflix to win subscribers.  Netflix is just one of the bidders for Los Angeles-based Regency Outdoor and there is no certainty that its offer will prevail, the sources said this week, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.  Netflix declined to comment. Its shares were close to unchanged in a slightly lower market. Regency Outdoor did not respond to a request for comment.

REUTERS/Mike Blake  ANALOG ADS, DIGITAL CONTENT  The world\u2019s leading streaming media company still uses physical advertising space such as billboards to promote its shows. Billboards are holding their own compared to other forms of traditional advertising such as ads in newspapers or TV that are easy to skip.  Regency Outdoor, owned by brothers Drake and Brian Kennedy, owns billboards on Sunset Strip, a portion of Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles known for its live music and night clubs and filled with splashy billboards promoting upcoming TV shows and movies.  It also has billboards at Los Angeles International Airport, on major freeways, near the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) campus, and close to the Los Angeles Angels baseball stadium, according to the company\u2019s website.  Netflix said in a letter to shareholders earlier this year that its marketing spending was growing \u201ca little faster\u201d than its revenue.  As a result of the bigger marketing expenditure, Netflix\u2019s expenses per subscriber will jump around 25 percent to $16 per subscriber, up from $13 per subscriber, according to a recent MoffettNathanson report. The company reported it had 117.6 million worldwide streaming subscribers at the end of 2017, more than any direct competitor.  \u201cAs the marketplace for original content becomes more crowded, Netflix is turning up the volume to promote the increasing number of Netflix originals,\u201d Michael Nathanson, a MoffettNathanson analyst, wrote in the research note.

FILE PHOTO: The Netflix logo is pictured on a television in this illustration photograph taken in Encinitas, California, U.S., on January 18, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo  Amazon on Wednesday rose over 2 percent and touched $1,500 for the first time, while Netflix rose also rose over 2 percent and nearly hit its own record high.  Investors, left nervous after major indexes slumped into correction territory at the start of the month but still confident about the health of the U.S. economy, are doubling down on already popular companies expected to post above-average earnings growth. Many of those are businesses poised to benefit from consumers and companies with more money to spend and invest as a result of U.S. tax cuts enacted this year.  Among such stocks, Amazon has climbed 2.7 percent since the end of January and Netflix has increased 4.9 percent, both outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 3.3 percent decline.  \u201cInvestors are willing to pay a premium for go-go tech stocks that can deliver returns in any environment,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. \u201cPeople are going to stay home and eat popcorn and watch movies on Netflix no matter what.\u201d  Analysts on average expect Amazon to increase its adjusted, non-GAAP earnings per share by 82 percent this year. Netflix\u2019s earnings per share are expected to more than triple, according to Thomson Reuters data.  That compares with expectations for S&P 500 aggregate earnings to expand by an unusually strong 19.1 percent in 2018, helped by a tax cuts and a stronger economy, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  In terms of their earnings valuations, Amazon and Netflix appear exceptionally expensive compared with most stocks. Amazon recently traded at 155 times earnings expected over the next 12 months, while Netflix traded at 94 times expected earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.  As the dust settles from the sell-off earlier this month, investors also remain optimistic about the technology sector. After leading last year\u2019s stock market rally, the S&P 500 information technology index in 2018 is in a neck-and-neck lead with consumer discretionary, both about 4.9 percent higher year to date. Amazon is the most heavily weighted stock in the consumer discretionary index and accounted for much of its gain.

REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger/File Photo  Following earnings growth of 20.5 percent for 2017, the S&P information technology sector is expected by analysts to expand its earnings by another 17.1 percent this year.  Overall S&P 500 earnings grew about 12.8 percent in 2017 and are seen increasing another 17.9 percent this year.  While analysts have increased their earnings estimates for hundreds of companies to account for new tax cuts, investors still lack a clear picture of how companies will spend their windfalls. Some companies may reinvest it, including spending on technology like cloud computing and cyber security.  Wedbush trader Joel Kulina said many clients who rode last year\u2019s rally in semiconductor stocks are turning to cloud and cybersecurity sellers.  \u201cRight now, they are the most favored pick in tech, whether it\u2019s Salesforce or Workday or IT security names like Proofpoint or New Relic,\u201d Kulina said. \u201cPeople think that no matter what happens, these companies are still going to benefit from more companies spending from the tax cuts.\u201d  King Lip, chief investment strategist at San Francisco-based Baker Avenue Asset Management, said Salesforce.com, which sells customer relationship management software, is his top pick in cloud computing, as well as a central technology at his own company.  \u201cWe can\u2019t imagine having to change our CRM system.

At 6 percent, its ratio is significantly lower than those of higher-rated media companies such as Walt Disney Co. and Viacom Inc.  \u201cIf you\u2019re in Netflix\u2019s position, it\u2019s something you should talk about,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best way to position your credit profile.\u201d  A representative from Netflix declined to comment.  Subscriber Growth  The world\u2019s largest online TV network reported its strongest year of subscriber growth to date, propelling its market capitalization in line with the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. Its shares jumped as much as 13 percent to $257.71 in New York.  Yet splurging on new shows comes at a cost. The company has said it will spend as much as $8 billion on programming this year, and disclosed Monday it will shell out another $2 billion for marketing. Long-term debt stood at $6.5 billion at year-end, while long-term content liabilities totaled $3.33 billion.  The stock surge prompted multiple equity analysts to raise their price targets on the stock, but the optimism wasn\u2019t shared by all. Matthew Harrigan, an analyst at Buckingham Research Group, downgraded the stock to neutral from buy, saying he\u2019s skeptical that the company can replicate its domestic success abroad, especially in Asia where the local competition is dense and Netflix lacks pricing power.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got to step back and do a sanity check on this,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a great product and are competing with other great media companies. But this isn\u2019t like Amazon, where it has the opportunity to take over the world with AI and penetrate every retail category.\u201d  Chief Financial Officer David Wells said on an earnings call late Monday that as the company continues to build its content, some of the factors influencing its working capital needs have started to moderate.  \u201cAs our operating profit grows, we\u2019ll be able to pay more for that organically,\u201d he said.  Content and subscriber growth are the roots to Netflix\u2019s success, which is why it\u2019s hard to see the company pulling back from that to help turn cash flow positive, said Rahim Shad, a high-yield analyst at Invesco Ltd.  \u201cWith Hulu and Amazon making their own strides in original content, you almost have to spend your way to remain relevant and successful at this game,\u201d Shad said in an interview. The upside case for the bonds would be a takeover by an investment-grade company like Apple Inc., as Disney plans to acquire a majority of 21st Century Fox Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. is already developing its own content, he said.  Netflix also said it doesn\u2019t expect the new limitation on interest deductibility in the recently passed U.S. tax law to affect its business. That aspect of the law has been seen to deal a blow to junk-rated companies, especially those rated B and lower.

As Netflix continues to ramp up its annual content investment, the streamer has effectively changed the paradigm for content producers in a way that both expands and limits opportunities for producers and studios as well as for rival networks competing for the best content and talent, per Digiday.  Netflix CFO David Wells said recently that in 2018, Netflix will spend $8 billion and produce 700 pieces of original content, including 80 full-length original movies and 80 foreign-language original productions from local international territories where Netflix operates.  Thanks to its massive spending, Netflix has created a seller's market for producers and studios. Here are some of the fundamental ways that the new paradigm initiated under Netflix has benefited content producers:  There are more opportunities to sell content because Netflix is such a major buyer. In addition to buying more shows than other platforms and networks, Netflix also buys more episodes.  Netflix pays producers more money upfront than other programmers.  Netflix is mostly hands-off once it agrees to buy a piece of content, and will largely give producers creative free rein over their projects.  Netflix shows and movies can still be recognized in traditional modes, for example, with critical acclaim or awards.

Netflix is accessible through Altice One, which is Altice's device that allows users to access streaming services like YouTube and Pandora. Netflix is partnering with an increasing number of cable providers, and is also integrated into Comcast's Xfinity X1 set-top box.  Under the partnership, Altice customers who aren't already subscribed to Netflix can do so directly through Altice One. Altice USA is one of the US' largest broadband communications and video service providers, with 3.4 million residential pay-TV customers as of Q3 2017. For context, Comcast reported 21.3 million residential video customers for FY 2017.  The Netflix-Altice partnership represents Netflix's ambition to grow through bundling with TV and internet providers. In Q2 2017, Netflix partnered with telecom SFR Group, a France-based subsidiary of Altice, to be sold with SFR's internet and TV services, for example. Bundling with TV and internet providers is mutually beneficial \u2014 Netflix can increase its reach in new markets, while its partners are able to upsell existing customers to more expensive packages.  Bundling with cable operators allows Netflix to capitalize on consumers who view linear TV and OTT services as complementary. A September 2017 study found that 49% of consumers who had their pay-TV service for four years or more subscribe to an OTT service, per TiVo. Even with the broader trend of consumers relying less on linear TV in favor of cheaper digital alternatives, Netflix can grow through set-top box partnerships by capturing long-term pay-TV subscribers who use OTT services in addition to pay-TV.

Netflix has poached prolific US TV producer Ryan Murphy from 21st Century Fox in a deal worth up to $300 million, making it one of the biggest TV production deals ever signed, the Financial Times reports.  Murphy will begin creating content exclusively for Netflix in July, and the series he created at 21st Century Fox, including \"American Horror Story\" and \"Feud,\" will remain on the company's networks. The deal will deepen the existing relationship between Netflix and Murphy, who previously signed a deal to executively produce a Netflix series in February 2017.  Fox bid aggressively to retain Murphy, but the producer's decision to move to Netflix makes sense for two key reasons:  Murphy's dodging the uncertainty surrounding the Disney-Fox acquisition. Murphy maintains close relationships with Fox Television Group Chairman Dana Walden and 21st Century Fox President Peter Rice. However, should Disney's landmark acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox's assets close as expected, it's not guaranteed that Walden and Rice will remain in their roles. This uncertainty factored into Murphy's decision to move.  Murphy maintains close relationships with Fox Television Group Chairman Dana Walden and 21st Century Fox President Peter Rice. However, should Disney's landmark acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox's assets close as expected, it's not guaranteed that Walden and Rice will remain in their roles. This uncertainty factored into Murphy's decision to move. He's gaining the creative freedom that comes with producing for a video streaming service. Murphy is known for his graphic and shocking work, and although the producer had virtually full creative freedom at Fox, working at Netflix will likely allow him to further explore his creative boundaries \u2014 creators generally have to worry less about profanity and nudity when creating for Netflix, as it's not a platform driven by ad revenue.  The deal is representative of the intensifying battle between digital video services and traditional media companies for top Hollywood talent. In addition to Fox's bid, Amazon also made a serious bid for the top Hollywood producer, according to The New York Times. Video streaming services like Netflix and Amazon are aggressively pursuing top creators and entertainers as eyeballs shift away from linear TV in favor of digital platforms.  Netflix has been successful in luring top Hollywood talent in the past year. The company poached accomplished producers Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers from ABC in August 2017. Additionally, Netflix has been able to sign separate deals with former Late Show host David Letterman, and big-name stand-up comedians Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle, and Amy Schumer. Netflix plans to spend up to $8 billion on original content in 2018, up from $6 billion in 2017, and its budget eclipses those of rivals like Amazon and Hulu, positioning Netflix well to continue to court top Hollywood talent.

Netflix's next 100 million subscribers will come from India, said Netflix CEO Reed Hastings at The Economic Times Global Business Summit (GBS) on Friday, per The Economic Times. For context, Netflix last reported 117.6 million global subscribers in Q4 2017.  The company didn't disclose how many India-based subscribers it had, but Consultancy Media Partners Asia estimates this figure at more than 500,000. To help grow its subscriber base in India, the company plans to release five to six Indian originals a year, and it announced on Friday three new Indian original series it's commissioning.  India is an attractive market for Netflix for several reasons:  Consumer spending in India is anticipated to more than double by 2025. Rising household income and economic growth are expected to boost consumer spending in the country to $4 trillion by 2025. Growth in consumer spending implies that the pool of consumers who can sign up for a Netflix subscription will increase significantly in the coming years.

Internet penetration in India has grown nearly sevenfold since 2009, per Kleiner Perkins. Meanwhile, Cisco predicts the number of internet users in India will rise from 373 million in 2016 to 829 million in 2021. And Indian consumers are increasingly viewing long-form online video. Online video consumption in India grew by five times in 2017, with videos longer than 20 minutes accounting for 96% of content viewed on Hotstar, India's largest video streaming service, per WARC. This bodes well for Netflix, which tends to focus on releasing longer-form original series over short-form original content.  However, Netflix's pricing strategy may cause Indian consumers to turn to more affordable streaming services. A Netflix subscription in India costs around $7-12 per month, depending on the package, versus $3 per month for Hotstar and $15 per year for Amazon Prime, which includes access to Prime Video. Hastings said Netflix hopes Indian consumers compare Netflix's price to movie tickets, rather than a typical pay-TV subscription, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Although Indian consumers will gain more disposable income in the coming years, the amount they're willing spend on OTT services will remain limited, which may inhibit Netflix's ability to onboard subscribers in the region.

Abrams is back for a third-installment that\u2019s tense and eerie, leaving you worrying how far director Julius Onah will push the frights.  The Cloverfield Paradox explores a world set to run out of energy in five years. A space station is created to test an experimental particle accelerator that could generate enough power to solve the crisis. But turning it on unleashes terrifying, reality-warping changes.  The film follows 2008\u2019s found monster footage collage Cloverfield, and 2016\u2019s 10 Cloverfield Lane, where survivors end up losing their minds in a shelter. But while those films felt zoomed into a tight set of characters, The Cloverfield Paradox encompasses a whole earth on the brink of panic.  Trapped on the space station, the film does meander a bit, but the spooky occurrences it pursues add to the film\u2019s overwhelming atmosphere of disorientation. It never fully forges a connection between the audience and many of the characters, though star Gugu Mbatha-Raw handles intense emotional weight as a grieving crew member.  Those looking to geek out on the science of global warming worst case scenarios will find The Cloverfield Paradox tantalizing. There are a few unresolved phenomena that are unnecessary, but it\u2019s powerful to see the crew crack under the pressure of a world looking to be saved.  The Cloverfield Paradox stumbles trying to cram climactic action into its claustrophobic quarters. This isn\u2019t an action blockbuster by any means. But an entertaining ending makes you want another film in the series back on the ground.  Netflix has managed to launch both a passable one-off, and a movie that keep Abrams fans subscribed until they can get another Cloverfield fix. And by announcing the previously delayed film would be available just two hours after its trailer debuted, Netflix shows its agile nature. The rapid release could ensure fewer people end up with the suspense spoiled, while avoiding overly hyped up expectations. It\u2019s a solid sci-fi story, served up swiftly when most films today seem to take forever to arrive.", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-05", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/04/cloverfield-paradox-review-trailer/"}, {"article": "If you can\u2019t get enough new Black Mirror episodes, Netflix confirmed that the series will be coming back with a fifth season.

It suggests that if a viewer is struggling with these issues, he or she may want to avoid the show or watch it with a trusted adult.  Netflix has also added a viewing guide to the website 13reasonswhy.info that is intended to help facilitate conversations between parents and teenagers about difficult topics.

Photo: facundo arrizabalaga/epa-efe/rex/EPA/Shutterstock  The world\u2019s media titans are locked in battle over Sky. The company driving the multibillion-dollar bidding drama is happily sitting on the couch: Netflix . NFLX 0.78%  Comcast gate-crashed an already lively party Tuesday by offering \u00a312.50 ($17.50) a share for Sky. That is 12% more than the \u00a310.75 on offer from 21st Century Fox and, by extension, Disney , DIS -0.04% which wants to buy Sky along with other Fox assets.  Including debt, the Comcast offer values Sky at $41 billion, which works out at 13 times expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to FactSet. Dish Network, traditionally a satellite distributor like Sky, trades on roughly five times Ebitda, after stripping out its spectrum assets, according to Will Milner at research house Arete.  Admittedly, Sky has a much stronger market position than Dish. It was the U.K.\u2019s first pay-TV company, with an offer anchored by Premier League soccer, and it has kept at the forefront of industry innovations like the set-top box and \u201cover-the-top\u201d streaming. As a result, it still serves more than twice as many U.K. households as its closest peer, Liberty Global\u2019s Virgin Media cable network.  This is Sky\u2019s essential appeal to both Comcast and Disney. It has a direct relationship with 23 million customers, not far from Comcast\u2019s 29 million. And they are mainly in markets\u2014the U.K. and Ireland\u2014that are already familiar with the kind of English-language TV content that both Comcast and Disney own and produce. In this Sky has no real peers.  Streaming giant Netflix\u2019s high stock-market valuation shows the appeal to investors of a global \u201cdirect-to-consumer\u201d platform. Something of this high valuation is now rubbing off on Sky as Disney and Comcast are both feeling increasing pressure to roll out something that competes with Netflix.  Both U.S. cable-and-media groups look set to be major beneficiaries of U.S. tax cuts, giving them cash to splurge. And given the antitrust uncertainty surrounding AT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner, it is easy to see why Comcast has opted to focus on Sky rather than Fox. For regulators, Comcast may be the preferred bidder, with none of the issues about concentration of ownership in British media that have dogged Fox\u2019s bid.  The irony here is that Sky is itself being disrupted by streaming. Its growth has become increasingly dependent on its own over-the-top product, Now TV, which is much cheaper than its old full-service package. Some 2% to 3% of households are trading down from the premium package to Now TV a year. Stripping out mobile-phone contracts, research firm New Street Research estimates that Sky\u2019s U.K. subscription revenue\u2014the bedrock of its business\u2014rose just 0.8% year over year in the most recent quarter. Meanwhile, heavy technology investments have weighed on cash flows.  Sky shares rose to \u00a313.40 in afternoon trading Tuesday, suggesting investors expect a counteroffer from Fox or Disney. But the U.S. media giants should be wary of engaging in a bidding war for what is essentially an incumbent TV provider. Sky could end up part of the problem, not part of the solution.

The company added 8.3 million streaming users\u2014the most it has ever gained in a quarter\u2014exceeding the 6.3 million net additions it had projected. The growth in the U.S. and internationally brought its total paid subscriber count to 110.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter.  The results showed Netflix can continue to grow its customer ranks despite price increases in the U.S. and rising competition for viewers and programming from rival streaming services. Netflix shares gained 9% after hours, pushing the company\u2019s market capitalization above $100 billion.  In a letter to shareholders, Netflix acknowledged the emergence of more premium video content from technology companies like Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., ad-supported platforms such as Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube, and entertainment companies like Walt Disney Co. , which underscored its direct-to-consumer ambitions when it agreed to purchase most of 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion.  \u201cThe market for entertainment time is vast and can support many successful services,\u201d the company said in the letter. \u201cEntertainment services are often complementary given their unique content offerings.\u201d  The expansion of direct-to-consumer video gave viewers an all-time high of 487 scripted shows across streaming and traditional TV in 2017, according to research from FX Networks.

Netflix said Monday it would spend $7.5 billion to $8 billion on content this year, up from a forecast of $7 billion to $8 billion previously, far outstripping investments from rivals including Hulu, Amazon and HBO.  And Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on the company\u2019s earnings call that content costs will continue to rise in 2019 and 2020.  Netflix said it now has $17.7 billion in streaming-content obligations, a measure of current and future costs for content acquisition, licensing and production.  In a rare move, the company took a $39 million noncash charge in the fourth quarter on content it decided not to release, which Chief Financial Officer David Wells said was \u201crelated to the societal reset around sexual harassment.\u201d Last year, Netflix cut ties with actor Kevin Spacey after he was accused of sexual harassment, and the streaming service said it would bring the hit drama \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d back for one final season without Mr. Spacey.

So how did we get here? Illustration: Shaumbe Wright/WSJ  The increased spending comes with a trade-off, as Netflix blew through $2 billion more in cash than it brought in last year, and this year the company projects negative free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion. But the company said Monday that rising operating profits and slowing growth in original content spending will eventually lead to positive free cash flow.  \u201cThey are spending more on content and burning more cash,\u201d Anthony DiClemente, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, said. \u201cHowever, as long as the revenue growth is accelerating and the net subscriber additions continue, investors will look past the spending.\u201d  Netflix shares set a record closing price on Monday at $227.58, about 227 times earnings.  The company added 6.36 million foreign subscribers in the quarter, compared with its forecast of 5.05 million. It added 1.98 million U.S. subscribers, compared with its outlook for 1.25 million.  Netflix expects the growth to continue in the current quarter, projecting net additions of 1.45 million U.S. subscribers and 4.9 million international customers.  Netflix has increased its international investments in recent years. More than half of its total subscribers are from countries outside the U.S. and it plans over 30 international-focused original series this year, including in France, Poland, India and Korea. Monday, the company said the international segment contributed positively to the company\u2019s full-year profit for the first time.  Netflix said revenue increased 33% to $3.29 billion in its fourth quarter, above analysts\u2019 estimates.  Net income came in at $185.5 million, or 41 cents a share, compared with $66.7 million, or 15 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.

He and his cast sampled the Mexican staple everywhere from the Yucat\u00e1n to Copenhagen.  One of his favorite tacos came from a food truck in L.A. It featured ingredients usually associated with the Middle East\u2014shawarma (meat sliced from a turning spit) and a thick, pitalike flour tortilla. In the show, he traced the history of these \u201cArab tacos\u201d back to the city of Puebla, about 80 miles southeast of Mexico City. There, Mr. Chang learned, immigrants from the Middle East helped to create the tacos decades ago.  He came across plenty of other cross-cultural connections in exploring other iconic dishes for the show. In Houston, he tasted Viet-Cajun crawfish, a combination of a New Orleans Creole dish with Vietnamese seasoning. In Italy, he noted how much tortellini look like wontons. \u201cEvery type of food came from somewhere else,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that just sprouted from someone\u2019s head.\u201d  Mr. Chang, 40, is best known for founding the Momofuku Group, with over a dozen Asian-inspired restaurants around the world, as well as six locations of the fast-casual chain Fuku and 13 Milk Bar dessert stores. He\u2019s still expanding his restaurant empire, which offers indulgent, sometimes oddball dishes such as kimchi bacon burgers and his much-imitated barbecued pork-belly buns. The chef and his restaurants have won five James Beard Awards, and one of the New York locations, Momofuku Ko, has carried two Michelin stars since 2009.  \u201cI think Momofuku has always tried to be a merger of things that don\u2019t always go together,\u201d Mr. Chang says. As for his show, \u201cwhen you say the word \u2018ugly delicious\u2019 it made sense.\u201d Many of his favorite dishes, such as curries and noodles, look ugly, he says.  The show\u2019s eight thematic episodes range from fried chicken to pizza to barbecue. The series asks why some cultures and not others readily assimilate new foods and dishes from afar. An area\u2019s tradition and its immigration history are major factors, Mr. Chang discovered. New Orleans, he found, was hesitant to accept new flavors and experimentation, in part thanks to a proud Creole culinary past. Houston, on the other hand, embraced waves of immigrants and their cooking techniques.  Mr. Chang now appreciates his own culture more, he says, partly because he \u2018ran away from it to begin with.\u2019 Photo: Austin Hargrave for The Wall Street Journal  For Mr. Chang, such stories have a strong personal resonance. The son of Korean immigrants, he grew up outside of Washington, D.C., in suburban Virginia. His mother made fried rice and chicken soup and his grandmother would make Korean dumplings, he remembers. His father used to take him to local pho and ramen spots, where Mr. Chang would watch in wonder as the chefs worked the dough and pulled it into long strands. \u201cThat\u2019s how my dad expressed love to me, by going out to eat,\u201d he says.  His parents were in the restaurant business for a time, but their two establishments served American fare\u2014 salads, soups and steaks. Mr. Chang never thought he would grow up to be a chef. \u201cI knew restaurants were in my dad\u2019s blood,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand until later that it could be a profession.\u201d  Mr. Chang was a champion golfer in high school, and his father wanted him to try being a professional, but he didn\u2019t enjoy the sport. Unsure of a career, he spent two years after college teaching English in Japan, where he fell in love with the local ramen shops. He kept copious notes of what he saw there, right down to the flavorings in the first slurp of soup.  When he returned to the U.S., he took a desk job in finance\u2014and hated it. He quit after six months and enrolled at the French Culinary Institute (now the International Culinary Center) in New York, with stints afterward at high-end restaurants in the city such as Craft and Caf\u00e9 Boulud.  When he finally decided to strike out on his own, it was to embrace the Asian food of his childhood: \u201cI think part of it is accepting being me.\u201d He now appreciates his own culture more, he says, partly because he \u201cran away from it to begin with.\u201d  In 2004, Mr. Chang started Momofuku Noodle Bar as a casual ramen spot. In six months, once he adjusted the menu to his liking, lines started forming out the door. His restaurant empire has expanded relentlessly since then.  Critics heaped praise on Mr. Chang\u2019s early restaurants but have not been as enthusiastic about one recent venture. A 2016 review of his new Italian-inflected restaurant by New York Times food critic Pete Wells was headlined: \u201cDavid Chang\u2019s Magic Shows a Little Wear.\u201d  Mr. Chang responded to the review in a New Yorker profile of Mr. Wells, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s being a [expletive] bully.\u201d These days, Mr. Chang thinks that customer reviews on services such as Yelp carry just as much weight as the opinions of professional critics.  Mr. Chang has experienced some failures as his business has expanded. Last year, he attempted to launch his own meal-preparation and delivery service, and a few years before that he invested in another. Both have since closed. Mr. Chang has said that delivery services were difficult to get right.  But the chef is still creating new concepts for restaurants and figuring out where to start them. Majordomo, which opened earlier this year in L.A., offers creative takes on basics and recently included short ribs with beef rice and shiso rice paper, and macaroni and chickpeas with black pepper.  Mr. Chang remains committed to experimenting and expanding. \u201cIt\u2019s this giant thing, and I don\u2019t know how it grows, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to grow.\u201d But he worries, too: \u201cEvery day feels like it\u2019s all going to end simultaneously.\u201d  Write to Alexandra Wolfe at alexandra.wolfe@wsj.com", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-07", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/david-changs-culinary-mash-ups-1523030104"}, {"article": "SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp unveiled on Tuesday a simulator that leverages cloud computing power to test autonomous vehicles, the latest move involving driverless cars that has helped more than double the chipmaker\u2019s stock in the past 12 months.  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, speaks at the 2018 Nvidia GPU conference in San Jose, California, U.S. March 27, 2018. REUTERS/Alexandria Sage  The Silicon Valley firm is ubiquitous in the budding self-driving technology sector, with ongoing partnerships with automakers, technology companies and auto suppliers, including Tesla Inc, Uber Technologies Inc, China\u2019s Baidu Inc and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE).  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the company\u2019s annual GPU Conference in San Jose that the cloud-based system, Nvidia DRIVE Constellation, was based on two different servers, with no need for a physical car. One server simulates the vehicle\u2019s many sensors, and the other runs the vehicle\u2019s software to process the simulated data.  FILE PHOTO - The logo of technology company Nvidia is seen at its headquarters in Santa Clara, California February 11, 2015. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith  Nvidia has said that using simulation, some 300,000 miles (483,000 km) can be driven in five hours, essentially every paved road in the United States simulated in just two days.  The technology is designed to allow automakers and others to validate their technology on billions of driving miles and increase the strength of their algorithms by repeatedly testing difficult scenarios, which would be impractical in the real world.  The software can simulate glare at sunset, snowstorms, poor road surfaces and dangerous situations to test the vehicle\u2019s ability to react.  Questions over the safety of self-driving cars are swirling in the wake of a fatality involving an Uber self-driving vehicle in Arizona.  Companies generally supplement their real-world driving by simulations, which allow them to cover more miles and so-called tricky \u201cedge cases\u201d more efficiently and more cheaply.  The Nvidia DRIVE platform is now used by over 370 companies developing self-driving technology, including automakers and robotaxi companies and those making self-driving hardware, such as sensors, said Huang.

The NYSE FANG+ index, tracking the FANG block and its megacap brethren, tumbled 5.6 percent in the biggest rout in data going back to September 2014.  Twitter Inc. led the plunge with a 12 percent decline as all 10 index members retreated. Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet Inc. slumped at least 3.8 percent.  Many of the big names in the industry had their own reasons for bad days: Twitter being targeted by short sellers, Facebook\u2019s ongoing privacy scandal and Nvidia Corp.\u2019s suspension of driving vehicle testing, for starters. Not to mention growing doubts over Tesla Inc.\u2019s new models and a second probe into a car crash.  But for skeptics such as Jeff Gundlach and Howard Marks, the plunge is long overdue. The FANG index\u2019s advance from early 2016 through this month\u2019s peak reached an annualized rate of 67 percent, outpacing even the Nasdaq Composite Index\u2019s return in the final two years of the dot-com bubble.  \u201cIt\u2019s been such a good performer that at this point it\u2019s kind of on the defensive,\u201d Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co., said by phone. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people with so many gains in technology.\u201d  There is also a valuation case to be made for the intensified selling. While the FANG companies\u2019 dominance in areas from social media to e-commerce will foster faster growth, their multiples are eye-watering.  Valuation Case  At 65 times earnings in mid March, the group was valued almost three times as richly as the S&P 500 Index. That\u2019s comparable with tech stocks in March 2000.  Since peaking on March 12, the FANG index has fallen in all but three days, sliding 12 percent along the way. Tuesday\u2019s drop wiped off about $180 billion in market value.  \u201cThe fact that the tech selloff accelerated in afternoon on heavy volume probably means a selloff will continue,\" said Stephen Carl, head trader at Williams Capital Group. \u201cOne thing is feeding into another here: uncertainty over the tariffs, Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony, weakness in Tesla. People don\u2019t know which way things are going to go and are taking profits.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Elena Popina", "stock": "NVDA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-27/fang-darlings-bleed-as-index-posts-biggest-loss-on-record"}, {"article": "S&P futures are already giving back almost half of yesterday\u2019s big run, the VIX is starting to tick higher, and crude continues to break out (Brent now well above $71/bbl) as the drumbeat gets louder over possible U.S. involvement in Syria.  And just as 7am crosses, Trump tells Russia via Twitter to \u201c get ready,\u201d because missiles are coming at Syria.  There wasn\u2019t a ton of news out otherwise besides further details over China President Xi\u2019s pledges, CNN reporting that Trump is considering firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and a seemingly disappointing data point in the agriculture machinery space in Deere\u2019s monthly sales figures.  How\u2019d Zuck Do?  The early market gains from Xi\u2019s trade-war-soothing keynote held, for the most part, and accelerated once Zuckerberg took the stage at the first of two congressional hearings. The response was overwhelmingly positive to his cool, calm, and collected demeanor, as traders bid up Facebook (FB +4.5%) and the rest of the tech space (S5INFT +2.2%). Here\u2019s what the Street had to say about the performance:  Evercore ISI analyst Anthony DiClemente, who rates FB an outperform, said Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony was \"sometimes tedious, other times repetitive, but mostly -- and this is a good thing -- uneventful\"; he added that Zuckerberg delivered balanced and reasonable answers to questions and \"seemed to strike the right tone\" as he found plenty of common ground with the lawmakers; DiClemente saw little in the testimony that should negatively impact investors\u2019 view of Facebook\u2019s long-term growth and business opportunity  Suntrust analyst Youssef Squali, who rates FB a buy, said that while no major news emerged from the testimony, \"we believe that this is a seminal event, one that\u2019s likely to lead to increased regulation (a la GDPR)\" that should still favor larger platforms like FB and GOOGL in the end  Big Move, But Still Range Bound  Energy stocks had the best day of all (S5ENRS +3.3%, biggest upside move since Nov. 2016) thanks to a continuation of the rip in crude prices. The sector has been the big winner so far in April while the defensive sectors, like utilities and REITs, and the industrials (blame Brent oil\u2019s surge through $70/bbl for weakness in the airlines) have been clear laggards.  The market\u2019s move to the upside was on relatively decent volumes too. They were the second highest on the consolidated tape this month, and a major bounce back from Monday, where we saw the second lowest number all year.  We closed near the high end of the S&P\u2019s recent range, just shy of resistance at ~2,660 (while support still holds at the 200-day moving average of ~2,596) and we could see further optimism creep back into the market if we can break above this mark.  Excuses to Fade the Rally  But something we\u2019ve become accustomed to lately is these huge swings to the upside followed by swift plunges in the opposite direction, so it\u2019s altogether possible that investors will be looking for any excuse to fade yesterday\u2019s move.  Perhaps day two of Zuckerberg\u2019s grilling (scheduled for 10am) doesn\u2019t elicit the same response as day one, and the FAANGs, the semis, and the rest of tech fade hard -- Goldman is already out slashing estimates on chip darling NVDA and sell-rated AMD, with both stocks down ~1% in pre-market trading.  Maybe the latest headlines tied to Mueller, or the Cohen raid, or possible action in Syria will spill over into the market. Or perhaps a scorching hot CPI print (today at 8:30am), after yesterday\u2019s firmer-than-expected PPI, and some eyebrow-raising language in the FOMC Minutes (at 2pm) might help to spook the tape.  Watch the BKX for clues as we\u2019re only two days away from the kickoff to bank earnings. And as for tech\u2019s next major non-Facebook catalyst, it\u2019ll be NFLX\u2019s earnings on Monday after the close. The sell-side has been aggressively bumping up numbers over the past few days, so expectations are riding high: Morgan Stanley yesterday gave bull case $440 on higher conviction, Goldman today raised price target to $360 on a likely beat, and many others making similar tweaks to their models.

After all, the portfolio manager of the $4.5 billion Wells Fargo Growth Fund beat 93 percent of peers over the past year by piling into Amazon.com Inc. and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet Inc. But between Facebook Inc.\u2019s privacy scandal and the back-to-back fatal crashes at Uber Technologies Inc. and Tesla Inc., the tech-sector doubters are suddenly speaking out as one stock after another slides.  Ognar is unmoved: \u201cWe don\u2019t think the party is over.\u201d Nor do the bulk of his fund-manager peers, as it turns out. Behind the ugly headline losses -- including the FANG complex\u2019s worst-ever day on Tuesday -- there are data points that suggest that many funds are a long way from abandoning the industry that has added more to the wealth of U.S. stock investors over the past five years than any other. What\u2019s more, the Nasdaq 100 Index is actually the only major U.S. stock benchmark still in the green this quarter.  \u201cThink of things like your thermostat that used to be pretty basic and analogue. Now you can control them with your phone,\u201d said Ognar from his office in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. \u201cYour coffee machine, your coffee maker -- it\u2019s a huge secular shift that hopefully will continue to put up sustainable growth.\u201d  The stance on Wall Street strikes a discordant note with the backlash building in Washington. While it\u2019s too early to say whether Facebook\u2019s woes will lead to meaningful losses in users and advertisers, the drumbeat for tighter regulation has some wondering if it\u2019s a watershed moment for an industry that promised to change the world for the better.  \u201cYou have the darlings of growth stocks that are going through some tough times, and it\u2019s not going to be a short and quick story,\u201d said Jennifer Ellison, a principal of San Francisco-based Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough, which manages $4.2 billion. \u201cThis is a tip of that iceberg.\u201d  Even Amazon, largely shielded until now, was hammered on Wednesday by talk of a tougher government stance. Axios reported that U.S. President Donald Trump is contemplating ways to \u201cgo after\u201d the e-commerce giant, including whether to wield tax or antitrust legislation. The shares were down 2.1 percent Thursday as of 10:34 a.m. in New York, while the Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.5 percent.  Trump features again when it comes to Apple Inc. shares, which are more than 8 percent off their record high partly on concerns about the prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China. In a worst-case scenario, the U.S. could impose a tariff that affects iPhones and other Chinese-manufactured electronics. And car accidents have roiled market darlings Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp.  Not to worry, say analysts, who\u2019ve flooded email inboxes with reports reaffirming a bullish stance on the broader industry. The bull case? Tech fundamentals remain strong and, for all the worry over privacy, fake news and tech power, the U.S. giants are still cranking out products that people want to buy.  Facebook is sitting on a pile of cash so big that fines equaling the largest corporate penalties ever would amount to less than 7 percent of it. Alongside Google, its online dominance is so complete that there are few alternatives for users or advertisers.  Scarred, Intact  \u201cThey\u2019ll come out bruised and scarred but they\u2019ll come out intact,\u201d said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. who has maintained his buy rating and $210 price target on Facebook. \u201cRadio and TV aren\u2019t the future, we know that, digital is. And it\u2019s not going to affect the direction of the dollars, which is toward Google and Facebook. The question is what is the speed that they get there.\u201d  The damage to all these stocks over the past couple weeks remains contained if viewed through a wider lens. Even after Tuesday\u2019s 7 percent rout, Nvidia\u2019s stock is double where it was a year ago. Tesla, while losing almost a fifth of its value this year, is still up sevenfold from the start of 2013.  Analyst estimates and fund flows show few signs of panic. In fact, profit forecasts for the tech industry have been barely changed over the past two weeks despite the market turmoil. At 30 percent, the expected pace of growth exceeds all but one industry in the S&P 500 Index.  Investors in ETFs seem in no rush to bail. Take the PowerShares QQQ Trust Series, the biggest fund tracking the Nasdaq 100. Outflows peaked around $2 billion on March 19 and trickled down to less than one-tenth of that amount Tuesday, a day when Nasdaq companies lost $260 billion in market value.  \u201cTech has given us more than it has taken away,\u201d said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group LLC in Pittsburgh. \u201cThe future is going to have more connected devices.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Tom Giles", "stock": "NVDA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-28", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-28/in-precarious-moment-for-tech-stocks-are-still-finding-friends"}, {"article": "There's no U.S. firm more at risk from trade retaliation.  There's no U.S. firm more at risk from trade retaliation.  If there's a poster child for the tonic the current U.S. government has delivered to the country's corporate sector, it's Boeing Co.  Fueled by Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg's cozy relationship with President Donald Trump, orders for Super Hornet fighter jets and corporate tax cuts, its 146 percent share-price increase since election day in 2016 has outpaced every other company on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.    Thursday's 3.5 percent fall after Trump tweeted out plans to impose tariffs on metal imports should be a warning sign that, beyond the current clear skies, a storm is building.  One obvious risk is increased costs. About 80 percent of an aircraft's weight is aluminum, and Trump's promise to slap levies of 10 percent on imports of that metal represents a pricing handicap in Muilenburg's endless battle for market share with Airbus SE.  Flying High Boeing has put in by far the best share-price performance of any company on the Dow since Trump's election Source: Bloomberg  At the same time, that blow is likely to be cushioned by the fact that managing raw-materials costs is part and parcel of being a manufacturer. Aluminum prices have risen or fallen by 10 percent or more in all but eight of the past 30 years. Boeing, moreover, isn't a major buyer of aluminum straight from the pot: Most of its supply comes from Arconic Inc., the specialty-products half of the old Alcoa Corp. business. Shares of Arconic slipped 1.5 percent on Thursday, an indication it's expected to take part of the hit.  The bigger risk depends on how the coming days and months are handled.  There's probably no U.S. firm more at risk of trade retaliation from China than Boeing. Of the 10 American businesses that declare more than $5 billion of sales in the country, three -- Apple Inc., Las Vegas Sands Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. -- are dependent on consumer spending, so probably somewhat immune to government diktats. Six more are in the semiconductor and tech businesses that China wants to encourage domestically, so they should also enjoy a degree of protection. Against that backdrop, Boeing stands out like a sore thumb.  Odd One Out Boeing is the only non-consumer, non-tech U.S. company that declares more than $5 billion in revenue from China Source: Bloomberg  Most of its biggest customers in China are state-owned airlines and lessors affiliated with government-controlled banks. The few independent players could easily be leaned on by authorities to defer existing orders.  China Inc. has a sound self-interested rationale for pursuing an aggressive path. Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, is hoping to pitch its C919 jet as a home-grown competitor to Boeing's 737 and Airbus's A320, and announced last month it would make its first delivery in 2021.  Using a trade war to put one of the C919's rivals on the back foot seems the perfect way to crack open the Boeing-Airbus duopoly and advance the interests of China's own manufacturers. Should the current tit-for-tat over steel and aluminum spiral toward a trade war, few firms will find themselves in a more precarious position than Boeing.

The company, which specializes in systems that analyze faces and images on an enormous scale, said it closed a Series C round in recent months in which Singaporean state investment firm Temasek Holdings Pte and retailer Suning.com Co. also participated. SenseTime didn\u2019t outline individual investments, but Alibaba was said to have sought the biggest stake in the three-year-old startup.  With the deal, SenseTime has doubled its valuation in a few months. Backed by Qualcomm Inc., it underscores its status as one of a crop of homegrown firms spearheading Beijing\u2019s ambition to become the leader in AI by 2030. And it\u2019s a contributor to the world\u2019s biggest system of surveillance: if you\u2019ve ever been photographed with a Chinese-made phone or walked the streets of a Chinese city, chances are your face has been digitally crunched by SenseTime software built into more than 100 million mobile devices.  The latest financing will bankroll investments in parallel fields such as autonomous driving and augmented reality, cover the growing cost of AI talent and shore up its computing power. It\u2019s developing a service code-named \u201cViper\u201d to parse data from thousands of live camera feeds -- a platform it hopes will prove invaluable in mass surveillance. And it\u2019s already in talks to raise another round of funds and targeting a valuation of more than $4.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to explore several new strategic directions and that\u2019s why we shall spend more money on building infrastructure,\u201d SenseTime co-founder Xu Li said in an interview.

SenseTime plans to build at least five supercomputers in top-tier cities over the coming year to drive Viper and other services. As envisioned, it streams thousands of live feeds into a single system that\u2019re automatically processed and tagged, via devices from office face-scanners to ATMs and traffic cameras (so long as the resolution is high enough). The ultimate goal is to juggle 100,000 feeds simultaneously.  Police can use Viper to track everything from vice and accidents to suspects on blacklists. While civil libertarians say such systems have been used to track activists and oppress minorities in places like the Western region of Xinjiang, Xu believes the technology is essential and deployed in various ways by authorities around the world. China\u2019s police forces and surveillance footage are also important sources of training data for SenseTime\u2019s image recognition systems -- it claims to work with 40 city authorities in the country.  \u201cIt will not affect privacy because only authorized persons can access it,\u201d he said.  SenseTime claims some 400 clients and partners including Qualcomm, chipmaker Nvidia Corp. and smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. For 2018, it\u2019s projecting several billion yuan in revenues, Xu said. The startup\u2019s expanding its reach across augmented reality, popularized by services like Snapchat that impose digital stickers and images on the real world. And it\u2019s working with Honda Motor Co. to develop autonomous driving systems and is in talks to work with health institutions.  \u201cIn China there is an advantage in areas like facial recognition because of the privacy that exists in the U.S. and elsewhere in the EU, and some of the very best facial recognition technology in the world that I\u2019ve seen is in China,\u201d said Breyer Capital founder Jim Breyer, an indirect investor in SenseTime through IDG.  SenseTime is the largest, according to CB Insights, of a plethora of private AI outfits. Fellow facial-recognition startup Megvii Inc. raised $460 million last year, while smaller niche players from Yitu to Malong Technologies have also won funding. A key partner, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, is one of the world\u2019s biggest suppliers of security cameras and developing its own competing AI technology.  Xu says its ability to work across wide datasets and diverse products sets it apart from rivals. \u201cWhat is difficult is if you\u2019re dealing with different video streams in different formats,\u201d he said. While the company has long considered an initial public offering, Xu said those plans are on hold pending rules that facilitate tech listings in mainland China.  \u201cWe are still waiting for a fixed rule to come up with a new strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably not this year.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by David Ramli", "stock": "NVDA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-09", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-09/sensetime-snags-alibaba-funding-at-a-record-3-billion-valuation"}, {"article": "Thomson Reuters  Nvidia's recent selloff created a \"tremendous buying opportunity,\" Evercore told clients last week.

The stock is currently the 17th most held stock on Stockpile's platform and was the 13th most popular stock as measured by the number of shares traded in the past week.  Wall Street is similarly bullish ahead of the results. More than half of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg rate Nvidia a buy ahead of earnings and just 5.7% say it's a sell.  Enthusiasm from the Street might be waning, though. Goldman Sachs removed the stock from its conviction list last week and Citron Research said it would be waiting on the sidelines for a while. Both firms say they are optimistic about Nvidia's long-term future, but think the company's red-hot rise over the last year has left its stock price a bit too high.  Nvidia is up 16% so far in 2018 and 97% over the last year.  Investors will be looking for the company to talk about how the incredible rise in the price of cryptocurrencies impacted the company's results. AMD reported that one-third of the growth in its graphics business came from increased demand from cryptocurrencies miners.  Nvidia likely received a similar boost in the fourth quarter, but whether its a sustainable boost is still unknown. The company will likely have to show growth in its other businesses in order to impress investors.  The Wall Street consensus is for adjusted earnings of $1.29 per share on revenue of $2.676 billion, according to Bloomberg data.

Like, seriously.  Right now, in 2018, there are three architectures (that\u2019s right, three) competing to be the GeForce GTX 11 series of GPUs between Volta, Ampere and Turing. And, right now, we\u2019d have to put our money on Turing being the follow-up to the wildly successful, Pascal-based GeForce GTX 10 series graphics cards. We were kind of hoping Nvidia would reveal the identity of the architecture behind the GeForce GTX 11 series would be at GTC, but all we got was some AI and autonomous car information.  Similar to previous generational leaps, like Maxwell to Pascal, we\u2019re expecting the Nvidia GeForce GTX 11 series GPUs to bring efficiency, and maybe PC gaming as a whole, to an entirely new level with true 4K, 60 frames-per-second gaming powered by a single GPU.  Cut to the chase  What is it? Nvidia\u2019s next generation graphics cards for gamers  Nvidia\u2019s next generation graphics cards for gamers When is it out? Rumored for July 2018  Rumored for July 2018 What will it cost? Hopefully not much more than Pascal  Based on the latest reports from Tom\u2019s Hardware, which cited \u2018multiple independent sources\u2019 in the industry, we won\u2019t see Nvidia\u2019s next-generation graphics card release until July or later this year. Word on the Internet streets suggests that mass production of new GeForce cards won\u2019t begin until mid-June, so an earlier launch date seems unlikely.  If these rumors are true, the closest and biggest venue for Nvidia to make its big announcement would be Gamescom in August. That said, we haven\u2019t heard any more corroborating reports to suggest Tom\u2019s Hardware\u2019s information is correct.  Earlier reports from Tweaktown and Reuters suggested a Nvidia Turing announcement at the Game Developer\u2019s Conference or GTC 2018. Following that, cards were expected to be available as soon as April or May.  Although that timing would make sense, given the release date of the current line of Pascal cards in May 2016, as the year goes on it's looking more unlikely. And, now that GTC has come and gone with no mention of the next line of GeForce GPUs, it might be a while before Nvidia unveils its next line of GPUs.  Nvidia Turing price  Given the current state of GPU prices in a cryptocurrency-crazed world, we can\u2019t but help to predict higher prices for graphics cards in the near future.

For one thing, reports are still debating whether the successor to the Nvidia GTX 1080 will be given a GTX 1180 or GTX 2080 model naming convention. Then there\u2019s the question of whether Turing will employ GDDR6 video memory or HBM2, as seen on the Nvidia Titan V .

That hasn't been the case in recent years, however, as games focus less on pumping in more polygons and instead make small-but-meaningful upgrades with things like texture quality, resolution, lighting, and visual effects work.  Ray tracing looks to be another one of those seemingly modest, but potentially significant upgrades that will hit the gaming landscape in the near future.  What is ray tracing you might ask? It's a much more advanced and lifelike way of rendering light and shadows in a scene. It's what movies and TV shows use to create and blend in amazing CG work with real-life scenes. The drawback is ray tracing often requires extensive server farms to pre-render graphics. That's been too much to ask from a real-time, interactive video game running on a compact box in your home.  Well, at least until now. At the Game Developers Conference, Nvidia, Microsoft, and AMD announced initiatives that will finally make ray tracing possible in real-time games, which means dazzling effects and much more immersive game worlds. Here's a look at what to expect, who's involved in this new push, and what they're bringing to the table.  What is ray tracing?  Ray tracing is a rendering technique that can produce incredibly realistic lighting effects. Essentially, an algorithm can trace the path of light, and then simulate the way that the light interacts with the virtual objects it ultimately hits in the computer-generated world.  We've seen in-game lighting effects become more and more realistic over the years, but the benefits of ray tracing are less about the light itself and more about how it interacts with the world.  Ray tracing allows for dramatically more lifelike shadows and reflections, along with much-improved translucence and scattering. The algorithm takes into account where the light hits and calculates the interaction and interplay much like the human eye would process real light, shadows, and reflections, for example. The way light hits objects in the world also affects which colors you see.  With enough computational power available, it's possible to produce incredibly realistic CG images that are nearly indistinguishable from life. But that's the problem: even a well-equipped gaming PC only has so much GPU power to work with, let alone a modern game console.  Ray tracing is used extensively when developing computer graphics imagery for films and TV shows, but that's because studios can harness the power of an entire server farm (or cloud computing) to get the job done. And even then, it can be a long, laborious process. Doing it on the fly has been far too taxing for existing gaming hardware.  Instead, video games use rasterization, which is a much speedier way to render computer graphics. It converts the 3D graphics into 2D pixels to display on your screen, but rasterization then requires shaders to depict reasonably lifelike lighting effects.  The results just don't look quite as natural or realistic as they would with ray tracing. The benefits of this technology probably won't seem individually mind-blowing, but the collective enhancements could really elevate the realism of interactive game worlds.  Who is working on ray tracing?  Microsoft is the biggest fish in this new video game ray tracing pond, as the company announced DirectX Raytracing (DXR) in the DirectX 12 API. They've created the structure for introducing and computing rays in the world, and have made it possible for developers to begin experimenting with the technology to see what's possible in their game engines.  And they're not alone: Microsoft has been working with several of the world's biggest game makers and game engine creators to help introduce ray tracing into PC games. Electronic Arts' Frostbite and SEED engines will be compatible, along with the ubiquitous Unreal Engine and Unity engine seen throughout the industry.  Creators can get started right away, too, thanks to an experimental DXR SDK available now. Microsoft will share further insight at GDC 2018 this week.  Bringing ray tracing to life in games requires incredible GPU power, so unsurprisingly, Nvidia is also leading the charge. The company's RTX technology leverages a decade of work on graphics algorithms and GPUs, and they're working closely with Microsoft's DXR API to get developers up to speed quickly.  According to Nvidia, \"film-quality algorithms\" and updates to their GameWorks API will deliver lighting, reflections, shadows, and related effects with a previously-unseen level of fidelity. And Nvidia's incoming Volta-class GPUs will be compatible, of course.  And AMD won't be left behind, either. They haven't shared as much as Nvidia yet as of this writing, but they have announced \"real-time ray tracing\" capabilities via their ProRender rendering engine and Radeon GPU Profiler 1.2. However, AMD's announcement seems less focused on games at this point, and more about improving developers' workflows and results with a blend of ray tracing and rasterization.  When will we see the benefits?  While AMD's approach doesn't seem targeted towards games just yet, that same sort of mixed approach is probably what we'll see in the gaming world to start. As Microsoft's official blog post suggested, DirectX Raytracing will \"supplement current rendering techniques.\"  In other words, it'll make some improvements over rasterization, but not fully replace it. Even tomorrow's GPUs probably aren't fully up to that task. But ray tracing will be another tool in game developers' toolkits, and one that will become more and more important over time.  Microsoft suggests that ray tracing will gain more focus \"over the next several years\" for things that rasterization just doesn't excel in, including global illumination. \"Eventually, ray tracing may completely replace rasterization as the standard algorithm for rendering 3D scenes,\" the post concludes.  That's a far-off possibility, but these are important steps in the right direction. Nvidia's new tech demos show that companies like Remedy Entertainment (Quantum Break) and Epic Games (Fortnite) are already learning the ins and outs of ray tracing and delivering dazzling results.  It seems possible that we'll see ray tracing start to roll out in games running on high-end GPUs (like Nvidia's Volta series) in the near future, perhaps later in 2018. Nothing is concrete yet, however.  For now, though, it's exciting to think that this long-awaited ability is finally on the horizon \u2013 and it will only help bridge the gap in graphical fidelity between interactive worlds and the kind of incredible CGI work seen on the big screen.

With most of the best gaming moments being shared on Gfycat or as just plain GIFs, it was inevitable that Nvidia GeForce would be able to let you create some of your own. Nvidia has added the ability for everyone to export their Highlights as GIFs just as they could have previously shot short videos.  Highlights, of course, is a ShadowPlay feature the GPU maker introduced in August 2017 that automatically captures gamers\u2019 greatest moments.  Up until now users have only been able to share these moments as images or videos.

Now it seems the company is ready to break its silence for a second go with the Samsung Odyssey Z 15.  Samsung\u2019s Odyssey Z 15 is a new, thin-and-light 15-inch gaming laptop featuring Intel\u2019s new hexa-core Coffee Lake processors and a Nvidia GTX 1060 graphics chip. On top of that, the laptop features a bold new styling and dynamic cooling system.  Image 1 of 8 Image 2 of 8 Image 3 of 8 Image 4 of 8 Image 5 of 8 Image 6 of 8 Image 7 of 8 Image 8 of 8  Design  Samsung\u2019s first gaming laptops raised eyebrows with some interesting and questionable design elements, but the Odyssey Z 15 just looks plain gorgeous.  Looking at the laptop\u2019s screen lid alone, the thick fullers (or troughs) etched into the metal give the laptop a unique and beautiful identity. Though it might seem like the top of the notebook has a ridged surface, it\u2019s actually an illusion of the brushed aluminum finish on the flat metal.  Open the laptop, and you\u2019re greeted with an equally unorthodox form factor with its keyboard moved towards the bottom edge of the machine and a touchpad sitting off the lower right hand side. As with other similar gaming laptops, like the Asus ROG Zephyrus GX501 and Acer Predator Triton 700 , Samsung opted for this design to accommodate cooling for high-end hardware.  What\u2019s more, this form factor allows the laptop to remain at a relatively small 14.78 x 10.03 x 0.71 inch (37.5 x 24.5 x 13.5; W x D x H) size and 5.3 pound weight (2.4kg).  As with our past experience with other similar laptops, getting used to the Odyssey Z 15\u2019s right-handed trackpad takes some getting used to. But, with time, you might find the desktop arrangement of the pointing device even better than its usual place on notebooks. Thankfully, the keyboard on this 15-inch machine is also a joy, as it offers plenty of travel and \u2018crater\u2019 (i.e. concave) keycaps for a comfortable typing experience.  The Samsung Odyssey Z 15 also features some unique keys positioned above the trackpad to start and stop gameplay recordings on the fly.  Specifications  Looks aside, the Samsung Odyssey Z 15 is shaping up to be the brand\u2019s most powerful gaming laptop yet. At the heart of this machine will be an 8th generation Intel Core i7 processor with six-cores and 12-threads.  Alongside that, Samsung has integrated a Nvidia GTX 1060 graphics chip, which will promises to always deliver high-resolution graphics.  To keep the system running cool, Samsung has introduced a Z AeroFlow Cooling System. The set up includes a Dynamic Spread Vapor Chamber, the Z AeroFlow Cooling Design and the Z Blade Blower. In this arrangement, the laptop\u2019s two fans push cool air though the system to remove heat from the CPU and GPU at the same time while expelling hot air.  During off load times or regular use, there\u2019s a silent operation mode that promises to keep fan noise to a low 22 decibels.  Rounding out the Samsung Odyssey Z 15\u2019s configuration is a 1TB solid-state drive and 16GB of DDR4 RAM. There unfortunately isn\u2019t any mention of pricing and, for the time being, the laptop will only be available in China and Korea. A Samsung spokesperson told us we can expect the gaming notebook to arrive stateside in the latter third of the year.  Early verdict  The Odyssey Z 15 looks like Samsung\u2019s most promising gaming laptop yet.

This might lead you to hope that pressure could be eased when it comes to miners pushing prices up by purchasing gaming GPUs. But sadly, we\u2019re inclined to believe that may prove to be a false hope\u2026  At any rate, the rumor from Crypto Mining Blog is that Nvidia is about to release new graphics cards based on the firm\u2019s GP102 GPU (as used in the Titan X and Xp cards, and GeForce GTX 1080 Ti), with one specific board mentioned which is coming from Inno3D.  Apparently, this P102-100 mining GPU from Inno3D (pictured below) will run with 3,200 CUDA cores and a base clock speed of 1582MHz. It will have 5GB of GDDR5X video RAM and a TDP of 250W, and for cooling, will use dual-fans and five copper heat pipes.  As this is a dedicated cryptocurrency mining card, there won\u2019t be any video outputs to connect the GPU up to a monitor. Therefore, these products are strictly for miners only.  The graphics card will be able to achieve mining hash rates of up to 47MH/s in Ethereum, and 879H/s when it comes to Monero, and the leak claims that this information comes directly from the manufacturer \u2013 although Inno3D doesn\u2019t specify whether this is at stock clocks (as opposed to post-overclocking).  As expected, there is no indication of pricing at the moment, and that will obviously be a key talking point.  Once again, let\u2019s underline the fact that this is speculation at this point, although the details provided by the blog concerning the spec of the purported Inno3D GPU are pretty in-depth.  Image Credit: Crypto Mining Blog (Image: \u00a9 Crypto Mining Blog)  Pressure points  If this graphics card does indeed emerge in the near future as indicated, can we then hope that this will be one of a number of fresh mining models with Nvidia GPUs? Likewise, hopefully their launch might help take the pressure off the huge demand for GeForce gaming GPUs that are currently being used for mining, pushing the prices of these cards up massively.  As we mentioned at the outset, while this is certainly a grand hope, the reality is probably very different. For starters, we have to consider that there\u2019s a shortage of video memory affecting all GPU makers right now, and that isn\u2019t predicted to ease until much later this year.  So, these new mining cards will still face the same issue as gaming-targeted GeForce GPUs: quite simply, there\u2019s only so much memory to go around.  Secondly, from the chatter we\u2019ve seen online, miners are still eyeing up GeForce models as a better overall value proposition than dedicated mining GPUs. One issue is resale value: a GeForce GTX card will carry its weight going forward in that respect, whereas a video card strictly for mining \u2013 with no possibility for usage anywhere else due to the lack of display outputs \u2013 has very limited resale prospects.  Finally, another apparent thorn is speculation about these mining cards' pricing being pitched relatively high, so that GeForce cards may remain a more economical proposition anyway (particularly considering the aforementioned resale considerations).  This all comes together to suggest that miners may indeed buy these dedicated GPUs, but not ahead of GeForce models.  Price of profits  Naturally, a lot of this will depend on where Nvidia and third-party manufacturers pitch the price of these mining-specific offerings, and as they\u2019re cut-down cards, we could hope for the best. But the reality is given the memory shortage and state of supply and demand in the GPU market, there isn\u2019t any realistic incentive to chop into chunky profits.  So, how does all this add up overall? Assuming these cards are imminent, we may not see much price pressure relief in the graphics card market simply due to the way things are with the scarcity of video RAM right now.  But that doesn\u2019t stop this being a hopeful sign for the future, if not the nearer-term. Later in 2018, when the memory shortage is forecast to ease, perhaps we\u2019ll see more of these kind of dedicated GPUs emerging \u2013 and then the prices of gaming graphics cards could finally start to normalize again.

NVDA -1.32% , which has made a broad push to bring its computing platform into self-driving cars, said Tuesday it will temporarily halt testing of its driverless technology on public roads following the fatal crash of an Uber Technologies Inc. autonomous vehicle.  The company said its suspension involves its own fleet of test cars, which are being driven on public roads in California and New Jersey.  Uber has also used Nvidia\u2019s computing technology in its Volvo XC90 SUVs, the same type of vehicle that struck a pedestrian on March 18 in Tempe, Ariz. The two companies in January officially announced that Uber selected Nvidia\u2019s artificial-intelligence computing system for its fleet of self-driving cars and freight trucks. Nvidia\u2019s chips and software help robot cars instantly crunch the vast amounts of data from sensors and cameras to make split-second decisions.  It isn\u2019t clear if Nvidia\u2019s technology was in the car that struck 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, who later died of her injuries.  \u201cMost self-driving vehicle prototypes and test vehicles use Nvidia technology,\u201d an Nvidia spokesman said in a statement. \u201cIn some case, customers are developing their own software and we don\u2019t have details of their algorithms.\u201d The spokesman said Nvidia is seeking to find out more details on Uber\u2019s configuration and software.  An Uber spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter.  Police said the Uber vehicle was traveling at about 40 miles an hour and didn\u2019t brake before hitting Ms. Herzberg, who was crossing her bike outside of a crosswalk. Specialists in autonomous technology said the car\u2019s sensors should have detected Ms. Herzberg, and that the car\u2019s artificial-intelligence system should have understood she was a pedestrian.  Following the crash, Uber said it was temporarily suspending testing of its self-driving cars in four cities as investigators studied the incident. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday barred Uber from testing its cars in the state. At least one auto maker, Toyota Motor Corp. , decided to temporarily halt public testing of its own self-driving vehicles.  Nvidia, a graphics-chip specialist that lately has become the leader in chips for artificial intelligence, said in a prepared statement it was temporarily suspending tests \u201cto learn from the Uber incident.\u201d Its fleet of cars for data collection, which are driven by human drivers, will continue to operate.  Nvidia\u2019s stock was recently down more than 7% to $226.39 on Tuesday following the company\u2019s announcement, which was reported earlier by Reuters.  Nvidia has made big bets on developing artificial intelligence for self-driving cars, and competes head-to-head with Intel Corp. in developing autonomous technology. The company said Tuesday it is working with 370 companies on autonomous vehicle technology, including auto makers such as Audi AG , Daimler AG , Toyota, Volkswagen AG and Volvo Group.  Nvidia has emphasized safety in its autonomous-vehicle program. On Tuesday, the chip maker introduced a system for training self-driving cars using simulation rather than real-world driving of the type that resulted in the fatality in Arizona.  That system feeds computer-generated imagery into the company\u2019s automotive brain, as though the car were viewing the world through cameras and other sensors. The brain\u2019s reactions feed back into the simulator, which alters its imagery accordingly. The technology allows self-driving cars to encounter particular hazards any number of times so they can fine-tune their responses, the company said, ultimately improving their handling of real-world conditions.  In January, Nvidia announced that its self-driving car platform met the international safety standard known as ISO 26262, including features such as redundant functions in case one part of a system fails.

To be the first to know, please click here.  Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba upgraded the AI platform powering its Tmall Genie X1 smart speaker to include visual recognition capabilities, according to Ciol.  The AI platform, dubbed AliGenie 2.0, offers visual recognition capabilities via \"Genie FireEye,\" a new function in the Tmall Genie's mobile app. Consumers can attach their phones to a phone holder, called the \"Xholder,\" that's connected to the smart speaker, and then use their phone camera to scan items, which the device will recognize. It will then read aloud information associated with those items.  A robust AI platform with visual recognition capabilities could help Alibaba continue to grow its share of the global smart speaker market. Alibaba released the Tmall Genie X1 exclusively for the Chinese market in July 2017. It then captured 2.6% of the global smart speaker market in Q4 2017, making it the third-largest smart speaker vendor after Amazon and Google in terms of shipments, according to Strategy Analytics. The smart speaker is also the top-selling voice-controlled smart speaker in China, with 2 million units shipped since its release, and it's been connected to over 45 million smart home devices.  Bringing visual recognition to the Tmall Genie X1 is key to Alibaba's approach to the market. Alibaba is looking into retail, travel, and especially hospitality as areas for smart speaker growth, while its competitors are primarily focused on securing a place in the home for their smart speakers. With the new visual function, the Tmall Genie X1 will be able to scan and read over 40,000 medicine boxes, which could be crucial for individuals with visual impairments.  The device will also be capable of scanning book covers, and can currently read aloud over 117 books by Chinese publishers. Additionally, the Tmall Genie X1 will be able to interact with consumers through more than 20 simulated animations and facial expressions, allowing its users to enjoy an immersive experience that includes voice, visual, and touch interaction. Alibaba reportedly plans to implement facial recognition capabilities in a separate rollout to make the speaker even more engaging.  The addition of visual recognition to smart speakers marks the next logical step for vendors looking to expand use cases. The creation of new and immersive experiences with the addition of visual functions presents new avenues for businesses to interact with consumers, and will likely boost user engagement as a result. Visual interactive elements can also help businesses leveraging smart speakers to find new monetization structures, like visual-based advertisements and app subscriptions that are based on higher quality and more interactive experiences.", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-adds-visual-recognition-to-its-smart-speaker-2018-3"}, {"article": "Business Insider/Hayley Peterson  Kroger is in talks to partner with Alibaba, the New York Post reported Wednesday night.

Users just select the car they want through the Tmail app and have the option of taking it on a three-day test ride.  Apparently, the service taps Alibaba\u2019s services and providers potential buyers with discounts and incentives based on their usage on Alibaba\u2019s ecosystem.  The concept of storing cars in mechanical facilities is nearly as old as the car itself.

Storing cars in such a fashion has its benefits as it nearly eliminates theft, damage and often results in storing more cars in less space.

Alibaba is in the early stages of making an investment in Grab, two sources with knowledge of discussions told TechCrunch. Isn\u2019t yet clear what size that might be or at what valuation for Grab, which was last valued by investors at $6 billion.  In addition, the timing is unclear due to current anti-trust investigations into the Grab-Uber deal. The Competition Commission of Singapore has said there are grounds to believe the merger may violate the law, while other countries are looking into its implications. But still, there is intent from both sides and key investor SoftBank to make the deal.  Grab declined to comment for this story. An Alibaba spokesperson said the company \u201cdoesn\u2019t confirm on market rumors.\u201d  Alibaba and Grab first held talks over an investment last summer but a deal never materialized after the Chinese firm became pre-occupied chasing an investment in Tokopedia, the Indonesia-based e-commerce unicorn. That deal was prioritized because Alibaba\u2019s arch-rival Tencent was in advanced talks over an investment that could give it a foothold in Indonesia, Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy and the world\u2019s fourth most populous country.  Alibaba leaned heavily on its long-time ally SoftBank \u2014 an early backer of Tokopedia and Grab \u2014 to get the Tokopedia deal ahead of Tencent. That\u2019s despite Tokopedia\u2019s own founders\u2019 preference for Tencent due to Alibaba\u2019s ownership of Lazada, an e-commerce rival to Tokopedia. SoftBank, however, forced the deal through.  \u201cIt was literally SoftBank against every other investor,\u201d a separate source with knowledge of negotiations told TechCrunch.  Ultimately, Alibaba was successful and it led a $1.1 billion investment in Tokopedia in August which did not include Tencent.  TechCrunch understands that one condition SoftBank attached to the Tokopedia deal was that Alibaba would invest in Grab when the time was right. SoftBank is widely seen to have been the deal-maker in the recent Grab-Uber consolidation and now, with that transaction agreed, Alibaba\u2019s investment will follow.  The timing may be ideal for Grab. While it has plenty of money in the bank from past investments, Indonesian rival Go-Jek is preparing to expand into regional markets so the firm will need to brace itself for a new wave of competition.  Despite the background, this is far from Alibaba being strong-armed into an investment, a deal with Grab makes plenty of sense for the firm.  It has been actively seeking investment deals in Southeast Asia\u2019s top internet companies for some time, and Grab clearly fits the bill. In particular, Grab\u2019s focus on payments and its recently announced financial services play is aligned with Alibaba and its fintech arm Ant Financial\u2019s goals, too.  Last year, Ant Financial went on an investment spree which included multiple investments deals across Southeast Asia and the failed acquisition of MoneyGram. Involvement in Grab Pay, which is shaping up to be a major payment player across the region, would massively boost Alibaba and Ant\u2019s objective.  Finally, there\u2019s the good old competition factor. With Tencent an investor in Grab rival Go-Jek, Alibaba has motivation enough to back a horse in Southeast Asia\u2019s ride-hailing space.  As I wrote last year, the two Chinese internet giants have been carving up Southeast Asia\u2019s most promising startups in search of investments that give them a good position as the region\u2019s internet economy grows.  A report co-authored by Google last year forecast that Southeast Asia\u2019s internet economy will grow to $200 billion in 2025 from $50 billion in 2017. Right now, it is Chinese companies, not those from the U.S., that are seizing the opportunity.  Got a news tip?

Last week the Baidu-backed iQiyi became the latest group to list in New York, raising $2.25 billion in the biggest international Chinese tech listing since Alibaba.  Both Xiaomi, the smartphone and appliances maker, and Meituan-Dianping, China's largest provider of on-demand online services, are planning to float in Hong Kong this year, with Xiaomi seeking a valuation of up to $100 billion.  As Beijing steps up its efforts to attract Chinese tech companies, Hong Kong - which is expected to implement the weighted voting rights in the second quarter, reversing a long-standing one-share-one-vote principle - is playing down the competition.  \"There is no doubt that many firms will actively consider listing in the mainland, but we expect a strong pipeline of firms interested in Hong Kong as well,\" Li, the head of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, told a panel of the city's Legislative Council members on April 3.  He added: \"Competition is always a factor, but the mainland and Hong Kong capital markets have some fundamental differences that do not make us direct competitors.\"  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  How far China will crash Hong Kong's planned tech party depends, say bankers, on how it implements its rules for Chinese depositary receipts (CDRs) - which would allow investors in China to buy securities of companies already listed overseas.

CDRs are expected to trade in yuan, potentially creating an arbitrage opportunity with the dollar-denominated American Depositary Receipts or Hong Kong dollar-denominated shares they will be based on. Beijing is still in discussion with regulators, bourses and bankers on the issue.  Different trading mechanisms also present other issues. China has a 10 percent daily trading limit, up or down, on mainland stocks, which most expect would apply to CDRs.  \"If Alibaba rises or falls more than 10 percent in the US in an extreme situation, but in China, existing rules cap its move,\" said Wu Beihong, an investor who buys stocks in both China and overseas. \"How do you solve this issue?\"  Another question is how much tech champions would be expected to list at home, and how those shares would be sold.  If China's biggest four internet groups - Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu and JD.com - were to sell 5 percent of their existing shares in the mainland, that would drain $55 billion from the market, equivalent to a fifth of all the funds raised in the onshore market in 2017, according to UBS analysts.  That could hit the pipeline of mainland IPO candidates hard - or prompt a sell-off in smaller shares if investors wanted to raise cash for the returning giants.  The sales might also prove difficult to execute. Last month, Naspers, the one-third owner of Tencent, sold a 2 percent stake in the tech giant, raising $9.8 billion in Asia's largest-ever block sale and dwarfing any single sale in the mainland.  \"Do Shanghai or Shenzhen have the expertise to sell $10 billion in Tencent or Alibaba?\" asked one Hong Kong official who requested anonymity. \"That is a big ask.\"  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The irony of potentially selling and trading shares in China based on offshore listings of Chinese companies domiciled outside the mainland - which they have to be to list overseas - is not lost on investors and bankers.

Everything considered and as far as roommates go, it\u2019s actually one of the best you\u2019ll ever have.  (Update: Google Home can now make calls to landlines in the UK! This was a feature unveiled at last year's Google IO, and has now finally made its way into the home.)  That\u2019s because Google Assistant, the smart artificial intelligence that\u2019s built into the Google Home, actually makes life easier rather than more difficult for you. You can ask it to lower the thermostat for you when you leave, diagnose your symptoms when you\u2019re feeling ill or have it locate that funny clip from Colbert last night and throw it onto your Chromecast without any hesitation.  It\u2019s smart enough to tell you how much plane tickets cost from where you live to any exotic destination you can think of, or prattle off oddly specific information like how much a Macaw weighs (2.6 to 3.3 pounds, apparently) or how much a new piece of technology costs (\u201cAccording to TechRadar, the PlayStation 4 Pro costs $399 or \u00a3349\u201d).  But, ask that very same question using different words or in a slightly different tone, and Google\u2019s ultra-smart assistant suddenly forgets what it just told you.  That general problem \u2013 \u201dit works sometimes but not all the time\u201d \u2013 isn\u2019t just symptomatic of the $129 (\u00a3129/AU$199) Google Home; the Amazon Echo, the current smart home incumbent, is far from immune to them as well. In due time, both devices will get smarter, but as it stands both are more novelty than pragmatic purchases.  Google Home is far from perfect at the moment, but it\u2019s sure to get better over time as Google continues to work on its voice assistant technology, and we\u2019ll be updating our review regularly as new functionality continues to be added.  What's new for Google Home in 2017?  Google might not have shown up with new Home hardware to Google IO 2017, but its latest software update will make the six-month-old Google Home feel like a new machine. To that end, Google announced four major changes coming to the smart speaker in 2017: proactive assistance, hands-free calling, Bluetooth and visual responses. Read on for additional details.  Let\u2019s start off by covering the two biggest announcements first: hands-free calling and Bluetooth. The way calling is going to work when Google rolls out the feature later this year is that you\u2019ll import contacts from your phone and then, when you want to make a phone call, all you\u2019ll need to do is ask.  The Home will make the call from either a private phone number or, if you have your Google account tied to your cell phone, using your own number. From the sounds of it, all you need is an active internet connection to make the calls \u2013 that means you won\u2019t need a landline or even a cell phone to make calls at home.  Another big update, Home will now be able to use Bluetooth to sync up to other devices \u2013 a feature the Home\u2019s competitor, Amazon Echo, has had since it launched and had so far been strangely absent on Google\u2019s smart speaker.  In addition to the Bluetooth announcement, Google announced that the Home will support the free version of Spotify, SoundCloud and Deezer in addition to the music streaming services it already supported later this summer.  The other two announcements \u2013 proactive assistance and visual responses \u2013while neat, aren\u2019t going to radically change how you use Home.  Visual responses, a new feature on Google Home that leverages Google Assistant to send visual information to either your phone, tablet or TV, definitely feels like a swing at the Amazon Echo Show. However, while Amazon\u2019s device comes with a built-in screen to show you events on your calendar or what the weather outside looks like, voice requests on the Home go through Assistant which spits the results onto any Chromecast, Android TV and TVs.  Speaking of the Assistant, Google has recently added a useful new assistance function to its smart assistant that brings it in line with Amazon's Alexa: voice reminders. It's now possible for English speaking Google Home owners in the UK, US, Canada and Australia to set one-off or recurring reminders using their voice, even months in advance of events.  Any reminders you set using your Google Home device will also appear on your Android device as long as it's running software from Android M on. Even if your Google Home has more than one user, you'll only ever hear reminders for you.  Design  Now, because \u201cair freshener\u201d can be a varied description depending on where you are in the world, a more apt description of its shape might be a small vase \u2013 it has a wide bottom and a tapered top. Each Google Home comes with a standard, gray fabric base with a rubber bottom that can be swapped out for a different material or color for around $20 (\u00a318/AU$29).  So far, Google offers two types of bases to match your home decor: metallic and fabric, each with different colors and finishes. Metallic bases are made out of either painted steel or polycarbonate and come in copper, snow or carbon colors. On the fabric side, the three colors are mango, marine and violet, in addition to the standard white mesh listed above.  Pick up a new base for your Google Home on the Google Play Store  From a pure aesthetic point of view, Google Home is the far more attractive option when compared to the Amazon Echo\u2019s all-black canister shape. It\u2019s less ominous than the black monolith and it\u2019s also a fair bit shorter at 5.62 x 3.79 inches (142.8 x 96.4mm; H x D), which means it\u2019s easier for the Home to blend into its surroundings.  There\u2019s also some function to this form, however. The top, flat, inclined surface of the Google Home acts as a touch-capacitive panel, allowing you to change the volume, play and pause the music or activate the Google Home assistant with a tap. Once activated either by pressing the top panel for a couple of seconds or saying the wake word (\u201cOK Google\u201d or \u201cHey Google\u201d), four multi-colored lights twist and whirl to indicate that you\u2019ve caught its attention.  While Amazon\u2019s Echo has a physical control to change its volume, Google Home\u2019s touch controls feel less precise. We do however appreciate the inclusion of a physical button to mute the speaker, which means you can be sure when it is, and is not, listening.  Google Home generally does an ok job of picking up your voice with its two built-in microphones located on the top half of the chassis, but it doesn\u2019t work 100% of the time. Whether this is down to Google\u2019s software, or its reliance on two microphones rather than the Amazon Echo\u2019s five, it means you\u2019ll definitely end up repeating yourself or raising your voice to get its attention more.  Uncap the bottom base and you\u2019ll find a speaker and two passive radiators, which, considering the sheer volume the little device can put out, is impressive. The Amazon Echo has a few more speakers inside its chassis, and can therefore sound a bit better at higher volumes, however what\u2019s under the hood here is enough to get the job done.  Audio performance  While Google Assistant, the voice and smarts inside the speaker, might be the main attraction here, Google Home is actually a pretty capable audio device as well.  It can access all sorts of streaming services \u2013 Google Play Music, YouTube Music, Spotify and Pandora \u2013 and works as a Wi-Fi speaker thanks to its built-in Google Cast capabilities.  What that means in practice is that you\u2019ll be able to ask it to play nearly any song you can think of, and it will either find it on Google Play Music\u2019s 30-million-plus catalogue or, if you\u2019ve taken it up on its free trial offer, pull it up YouTube Music. Think about that for a second. Unlimited access to music on YouTube? Yeah, by far and away, Google Home probably has the largest song library of any audio device on the market.  We tried for an hour to find a song that Google Home couldn\u2019t pull up \u2013 recalling some seriously obscure music, like the theme song from 1998\u2019s Banjo-Kazooie game on N64 to the title track for Requiem for a Dream \u2013 to no avail. Of course, you\u2019ll likely stumble across something that Google Home can\u2019t find, but the fact that we couldn\u2019t stump it after arming ourselves with dozens of songs is absolutely unheard of.  Less impressive is how much difficulty the Google Home had with recognising band names that sound similar to one another. Try as we might, we couldn\u2019t get the speaker to play any music by the band \u2018Brontide\u2019. Sometimes it would claim that their music wasn\u2019t available (it\u2019s on Spotify), or else it would play music or playlists from completely unrelated artists.  It\u2019s also too bad the expansive library of songs is stuck \u2013 for the most part \u2013 inside a less-than-amazing-sounding speaker.  Compared to Bluetooth speakers in its price range like, say, the Creative Sound Blaster Roar 2 or Razer Leviathan Mini, music on the Google Home comes off as less robust with little separation and little punch in the low-end or clarity in the mids and highs.  Now, it\u2019s not completely incapable for playing decent-sounding music \u2013 it does have some bass and some mids \u2013 but, if you\u2019re expecting Google Home to replace your Hi-Fi setup, you\u2019ll be severely disappointed. (Audiophiles, keep in mind that a vast majority of the time Google Home sources its music from YouTube, a site infamous for its audio compression.)  But Google Home makes up for its less-than-pristine audio quality with a feature that other speakers don\u2019t have, and that\u2019s its ability to both receive and send Google Cast signals, making it the only audio device that can not only stream music from your phone, but send video streams to any Google Cast-compatible connected devices as well.  Google Cast and Chromecast performance  One of our smaller frustrations with the Amazon Echo Dot, Amazon\u2019s smart speaker that\u2019s designed to be plugged into an existing audio setup, was that there was no way to control which speaker was used as its output using voice commands.  In theory, Google Home doesn\u2019t have this issue. Simply set up a Chromecast with a name that\u2019s easy to pronounce, and you can tell your Google Home to cast your favourite songs or even videos to your Hi-Fi and TV respectively.  At launch in both the UK and Australia, it supported a number of local streaming services. For example, in the UK we were able to play BBC Radio 4 on the speaker directly, which it was intelligent enough to automatically stream from iPlayer, and it was also capable of streaming from Channel 4\u2019s All 4 streaming app.  In theory it\u2019s a great streaming solution, but in practice we had trouble with the functionality.  Take as an example the phrase, \u201cWatch Rick and Morty from Netflix on Jon\u2019s Projector.\u201d If your pronunciation is perfect then the command will work most of the time, but if the speaker fails to hear any part of the instruction then it will fail completely.  Then there\u2019s the issue of selecting specific episodes, which Google Home is unable to do. Ask it to play a show and it will start from where you last left off, but you can\u2019t ask it to play a specific episode. Skipping between episodes, meanwhile, works well.  We\u2019d love it if the speaker was intelligent enough to remember part of the command and ask for clarification on the parts that it didn\u2019t understand, but as it stands you have to get the whole command right in one go.  It\u2019s also a pain to control playback once you\u2019ve started casting. Instructing the speaker to \u2018play\u2019 or \u2018pause\u2019 works well, but if you tell it to play another song then it suddenly forgets that it\u2019s casting and will instead play the new song from the Home\u2019s own speaker.  The big promise with Google Assistant was that it would be contextually aware, but from our experience it has a long way to go. You\u2019ll find yourself repeating a lot of information that the Home should be able to work out itself.  Google Home as the center of your smart home  Of course, Chromecast isn\u2019t the only device that Google Home can talk to. There are a half-dozen devices that can hook into Google Home right now, or will be able to do so soon. (We\u2019ve compiled a list of the best Google Home smart home devices so you don\u2019t have to waste time tracking each one down.)  The highlights of what Google Home can connect to right now are Nest thermostats, Philips Hue lightbulbs and Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform, while support for even more third-party devices like LIFX lightbulbs and LG MusicFlow speakers should be coming soon.  Google Home will also integrate with thermostats from Netatmo and Tado.  Although you\u2019ll frequently need to sign into these third-party products, once you\u2019re in the functionality works well. We tested the Google Home with a Nest setup and found that its commands were easy and intuitive to give.  Recently, Google announced that Home would support several new smart home ecosystems including products from August, Wink, LIFX, TP-Link, Rachio, Vivent, First Alert, Frigidaire, Logitech, Geeni, Anova and US-retailer Best Buy\u2019s Insignia brand. Together, these should give you far more options for which devices you can string together and give you more control of your burgeoning smart home.  While further hardware integration is nice, one of the largest problem Google Home faces is that it can\u2019t integrate with many of Google\u2019s own services \u2013 like Gmail, Voice and Docs \u2013 which have been its bread and butter for years.  Take Gmail, for instance. You\u2019d think Google Home might be able to rattle off the subjects of your top 10 emails \u2013 but, surprise, it can\u2019t. The same goes for Google Calendar where it\u2019s unable to create new events (although it will happily read out existing events in your calendar), make phone calls with Google Voice or jot down some quick notes in a Google Doc. Google has a dozen services that the Home should be able to link into and yet, in its current state, simply cannot. Not only is this a big disappointment, but it makes us wonder why this functionality wasn't given more of a priority.  And while it\u2019s easy to hammer this point home and point out all Google Home\u2019s shortcomings in one long-winded tirade, we\u2019re not going to. That\u2019s not because we\u2019re avoiding the harsh criticism or defending the Home, we\u2019re not.  But we\u2019ve already fallen into that trap of being overly critical of a smart platform once before with Amazon Echo, and since then it has flourished into an amazingly smart, connected platform that can answer hundreds more questions than it could two short years ago. It can order pizza or restock the refrigerator or call an Uber or check what time a restaurant closes, and the list of everything it can do grows week over week.  Google Home can do some of that already, making it far and away a better system now than the Echo was when it first launched. Some of that it can\u2019t. But, speaking from experience, it\u2019s only going to get better, smarter and more robust in the coming weeks, months and years.  It\u2019s just not there yet.  We liked  One thing\u2019s for sure: You might never appreciate just how much music is on YouTube without buying a Google Home. While some of the biggest music streaming services in the world boast libraries of 25, 30 and even 40 million songs, they\u2019re far from complete. We\u2019re not saying Google Home is capable of playing any song you can think of, but after dredging the depths of the \u201990s we still couldn\u2019t find a tune Google Home couldn\u2019t find.  And while Google Home excels as a DJ, it\u2019s also a surprisingly intelligent smart home hub. It already hooks into some of the largest platforms now by including Nest, Philips and Samsung\u2019s SmartThings, and given a few months that number will grow even more.  Its Google Cast functionality is excellent, and has real potential.  We disliked  Clearly the lack of integration into Google\u2019s own services is a huge issue. The fact that it can\u2019t shoot an email to someone in your contacts or help you schedule events through Google Calendar are massive oversights that vastly reduce how useful the Home could be.  The other problem with Google Assistant is how precise you have to be when asking your questions. Asking what year a song was written might not turn up any results, while asking what year a song was released might unveil the exact answer you were looking for. Follow up any inquiry with a simple request like \u201cOK Google, tell me more about it\u201d and it suddenly forgets what you\u2019ve been talking about for the past 30 seconds.  A lack of contextual awareness is also a massive problem for its Google Cast functionality right now. Be prepared to reiterate where you want your music to play from a lot when using Google Home.  Admittedly, this lack of contextual awareness isn\u2019t something that Alexa deals with \u2013 which is surprising considering that the Echo doesn\u2019t come from the company with 20-plus years of search engine experience.  Final verdict  It\u2019s easy to feel disappointed with Google Home when you buy one and expect it to be the coveted center of the smart home Google has marketed it as. It\u2019s just not there yet. It\u2019s a bit too rigid in its language comprehension, its list of smart home devices is growing but still a bit underwhelming, and, perhaps the biggest disappointment of all, it doesn\u2019t have many of Google\u2019s core services built into it.  The best comparison for Google Home, obviously, is the Amazon Echo. They both have identical functions, fetch music from similar sources and are stumped, largely, by the same set of questions. While the Echo is still the more formidable of the two thanks to the dozens of developers who have created bespoke commands, the Home is \u2013 at worst \u2013 about six months behind in development.  There\u2019s also the issue that although the Home is more ambitious with its media playback, it hasn\u2019t worked out a way for you to access this functionality in a way that\u2019s simple enough to be done with your voice. There\u2019s little point in having all that functionality when it\u2019s a chore to use.  Given the same attention from hardware and software developers and some of those additional Google services, the Home could quickly grow from a nascent smart speaker with Chromecast integration to the first and most critical piece of the ever-expanding smart home.  For now, the Google Home is simply a smart novelty with access to YouTube Music, built-in Google Cast and the ability to save you a trip to the light switch.", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-16", "source": "techradar", "url": "http://www.techradar.com/news/google-maps-has-gingerly-returned-to-china-after-an-eight-year-absence"}, {"article": "A sign for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. at the fourth World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, China, Dec. 3, 2017.  A sign for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. at the fourth World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, China, Dec. 3, 2017. Photo: aly song/Reuters  SHANGHAI\u2014Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. said it will acquire a 33% stake in its financial services affiliate Ant Financial Services Group, in a move that could signal that Ant is being readied for a public offering.  The Ant equity purchase was announced as Alibaba reported robust third-quarter earnings of 24.1 billion yuan ($3.82 billion), up from 17.9 billion yuan in the like quarter the previous year. That topped a forecast of 21.6 billion yuan by analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.  Revenue for the quarter increased 56% from the year-earlier period, to 83.0 billion yuan.  Ant, which was carved out in 2011 during the run-up to Alibaba\u2019s own IPO, runs the fast-growing Alipay mobile payment platform used by Chinese consumers to purchase goods and services, including items on Alibaba\u2019s online shopping sites.  Alibaba said it will acquire the Ant stake as part of a deal approved in 2014. In return, the ecommerce company would transfer intellectual property to Ant, with no cash impact to Alibaba.  The acquisition of the one-third stake in Ant would put Alibaba in a position to benefit if Ant were to go public, which has long been anticipated. Ant Financial was last valued at $60 billion in a 2016 financing round, and the company has grown significantly since then.  Scott Freeze, chief investment officer at Sabretooth Advisors in Pennsylvania, whose fund owns Alibaba stock, said the move suggests Alibaba is preparing its Ant affiliate for a public offering and wants to profit from the company\u2019s mobile payments business as it expands in India, Japan and Korea and other countries.  Alibaba shares were down about 3.8% in recent trade in New York. Mr. Freeze said the sell off was an overreaction to the news, as the stake would give Alibaba access to direct revenue from Ant and more authority over decision-making.  Alibaba\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu declined to comment on IPO speculation.  The companies said that following Alibaba\u2019s stake acquisition, they would terminate their current profit-sharing arrangement which entitles Alibaba to 37.5% of Ant\u2019s pre-tax profit, paid in the form of royalty and technology fees. There would be no cash impact to Alibaba.  Ant paid Alibaba $30 million in such fees in the three months to December, down sharply from amounts in recent quarters because Ant spent heavily to grow its Alipay user base.  Ant paid Alibaba a total of $735 million during the 2017 calendar year, implying that Ant\u2019s pre-tax profit last year was roughly $2 billion.  In a call with investors, Alibaba Vice Chairman Joe Tsai said the Ant stake would allow Alibaba to expand its role of providing value-added services such as mobile payments to upgrade traditional brick and mortar businesses.  The agreement would also give Alibaba more firepower to expand overseas, as payment methods are a key component of online retail, he said.  In its third-quarter report, Alibaba said revenue from its core ecommerce unit\u2014which runs China\u2019s two most popular online retail sites, Taobao and Tmall\u2014remained strong. Sales rose 57% to 73.2 billion yuan.  Alibaba is seeking to expand beyond online commerce into physical retail stores as well, expanding its chain of supermarkets and making a $2.9 billion investment in China\u2019s second-largest big-box retailer Sun Art Retail in the quarter.  Alibaba said its cloud-computing business revenue more than doubled to 3.6 billion yuan, as it attracted more paying customers and introduced more paying services.  Sales from Alibaba\u2019s digital-media and entertainment division, which includes mobile browser UCWeb, video-streaming site Youku Tudou and Alibaba Pictures Group , rose to 5.4 billion yuan. Analysts say intense competition in the digital-entertainment space will weigh on the company going forward, as Alibaba seeks to invest in more content to attract new viewers.  Alibaba\u2019s Youku video-streaming platform attracted about 374 million monthly active users as of Dec 2017, behind Baidu-backed iQiyi and Tencent Video, according to Quest Mobile figures.  \u2014Chuin-Wei Yap contributed to this story  Write to Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-01", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/alibaba-earnings-jump-35-1517488507"}, {"article": "SHANGHAI\u2014Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

Alibaba founder Jack Ma, center, raises a ceremonial mallet before striking a bell during the company's IPO at the New York Stock Exchange. Photo: Mark Lennihan/Associated Press  Technology giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is working on a plan to list on a stock exchange in its home market, China, according to people familiar with the matter, more than three years after its blockbuster initial public offering in New York.  Alibaba is evaluating ways in which its shares could be traded by investors on the mainland, the people said. A secondary listing in China could happen as soon as this summer if the country\u2019s securities rules are changed to allow listings of foreign companies, one of the people added. While the bulk of Alibaba\u2019s business and operations are in China, the nearly 20-year-old company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands.  Chinese laws have long prohibited overseas companies from selling shares directly to local investors. China also currently forbids companies with shares that carry different voting rights to list on the mainland. Alibaba has a complex ownership structure that gives its founders and a small group of executives more control over the company than other shareholders.  The company in 2014 launched a $25 billion float on the New York Stock Exchange in what remains the world\u2019s largest IPO.  An Alibaba spokeswoman said the company has been considering a listing in China since 2014, if regulations would permit it.  Chinese authorities are trying to lure some of the country\u2019s technology stalwarts back to its capital markets. Alibaba\u2019s shares have climbed 86% over the past year and have more than doubled since their IPO, gains that investors in China have largely missed out on. The company now has a market capitalization of around $493 billion and is one of the world\u2019s most valuable technology firms.  In recent months, China\u2019s securities regulator has been in touch with several investment banks to discuss ways to allow companies listed abroad to issue securities on the mainland, the Journal previously reported.  Liu Shiyu, chairman of the Chinese securities regulator, recently confirmed the government has been working to win over overseas Chinese listings. \u201cYou will see results,\u201d he said on the sidelines of a legislative meeting in Beijing last week. \u201cA bit slower than the firms expect and a bit quicker than you expect,\u201d he added.  Noting that Chinese investors haven\u2019t been able to profit from the share gains of some foreign-listed companies that he didn\u2019t identify, Mr. Liu called it \u201ca pity, a real pity\u201d and said this \u201ccannot happen again.\u201d China\u2019s securities regulator didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment Thursday.  Some of the regulator\u2019s discussions with banks have revolved around the creation of financial instruments called depositary receipts, which represent interests in the shares of foreign-listed companies.  Enticing Chinese tech companies trading abroad, such as Alibaba, Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. , to list at home has become a national priority in recent months.  Chinese regulators want large homegrown companies and promising startups to participate in its capital markets, giving retail investors an opportunity to tap into the wealth generated by successful companies, among other goals. Tencent, whose shares have also doubled over the past year, is listed in Hong Kong, while Baidu is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  A dual listing on the mainland would give Chinese companies the option of raising money domestically in their local currency and help boost their profile at home, said Rocky Lee, managing partner of the Silicon Valley office of law firm King & Wood Mallesons. He added that well-known companies could potentially fetch higher valuations for their shares from local investors, because their brands and businesses are better known domestically.  However, China\u2019s stock market has historically had a reputation for being akin to a casino, and some analysts have said the listings of a few hot names could fuel speculation by Chinese individual investors, who dominate trading in the markets.  From the Archives Alibaba is China\u2019s largest e-commerce company but it does a lot more than just sell toys and clothes. The WSJ\u2019s Ken Brown explains how Alibaba\u2019s network of interconnected products and services have led them to become the biggest e-commerce company in China. (Originally Published May 4, 2014)  China\u2019s securities regulator is expected to announce plans for a depositary share regime in the coming months, said people familiar with discussions it has had recently.  Depositary receipts are a common feature of major stock markets in the U.S. and Europe. Dozens of Chinese companies that are listed on the NYSE or Nasdaq have American depositary receipt programs typically administered by large banks.  In the case of Baidu, every 10 American depositary shares represent an interest in one of the internet company\u2019s class A ordinary shares. Alibaba\u2019s New York-listed securities are also American depositary shares, with each representing one ordinary share.  Another tech company that is considering listing in China as well as overseas is smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp., people familiar with the matter previously told the Journal. The homegrown company is planning to raise at least $10 billion in an initial public offering later this year, and has picked Hong Kong as its main listing venue but is also considering a concurrent listing on the mainland at the behest of Chinese authorities, the people said. Xiaomi\u2019s parent company is also incorporated in the Cayman Islands, and to list in China it may also have to use a depositary receipt structure.  \u2014Chao Deng contributed to this article  Write to Julie Steinberg at julie.steinberg@wsj.com and Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-15", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-tech-titan-alibaba-plans-stock-market-homecoming-1521116131"}, {"article": "Lucy Peng will focus on running Lazada Group, an operator of online retail marketplaces in Southeast Asia that Alibaba invested $2 billion in.  Lucy Peng will focus on running Lazada Group, an operator of online retail marketplaces in Southeast Asia that Alibaba invested $2 billion in. Photo: Misha Friedman/Bloomberg News  Lucy Peng, one of China\u2019s richest businesswomen, is leaving the helm of one of the country\u2019s most valuable private companies.  Ms. Peng, 44 years old, stepped down as executive chairman of Ant Financial Services Group, the giant financial-technology affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.21% that she led for eight years.  She is being replaced by Eric Jing, Ant\u2019s chief executive officer, who is taking on the additional chairman role with immediate effect, Ant said in a statement Monday. Mr. Jing, who is 45 years old, has been CEO since October 2016, when he took over the job from Ms. Peng.  Ant said Ms. Peng will focus on running Lazada Group, an operator of online retail marketplaces in Southeast Asia that Alibaba is using as a beachhead to expand in the region. Ant\u2019s statement said Lazada\u2019s growth is a key part of Alibaba\u2019s global strategy.  Ms. Peng, who is also one of Alibaba\u2019s co-founders, was named CEO of the Singapore-based company in March after Alibaba invested $2 billion in Lazada, adding to an earlier multibillion-dollar investment. She is also chairman of the company, in which Alibaba took a controlling stake in 2016.  Ant\u2019s management change comes as the company is raising as much as $5 billion from private investors, according to people familiar with the matter. The effort is widely seen as a prelude to an initial public offering of Ant, though there is no certainty the company will proceed with a listing in the near term. A spokesman for Ant declined to comment.  Hangzhou-based Ant\u2019s last announced fundraising round was in April 2016, when the company secured $4.5 billion from Chinese investors and earned a valuation of around $60 billion. Since then, the company has increased revenue, expanded its giant Alipay mobile-payments network, entered new markets and widened its scope of financial services for individuals and small businesses. It also has an asset-management business that oversees the world\u2019s largest money-market fund.  Ant\u2019s current fundraising effort includes local and foreign investors, who have subscribed to at least $3 billion of its shares, a person familiar with the matter said. Some market participants expect the latest share sale to give Ant a valuation of close to $100 billion.  Ms. Peng, who is famously media shy, has been a confidante of billionaire founder Jack Ma. She ran Alipay from 2010 to 2014, a period that spanned the business getting carved out from Alibaba and its rebranding as Ant. She went on to lead Ant as its CEO until 2016. Ms. Peng also became a billionaire after Alibaba\u2019s 2014 initial public offering.  \u201cShe definitely doesn\u2019t seek the limelight, but she gets on with it,\u201d said Duncan Clark, a former investment banker and chairman of tech consultancy BDA China, who wrote a book on Alibaba. Mr. Clark recalled that when some Ant staff pushed for transport and other perks similar to those provided by Western tech giants such as Apple or Google, Ms. Peng rebuffed them, telling her staff to focus on working hard. \u201cShe was very matter of fact,\u201d he added.  Before working at Ant, Ms. Peng held a longtime role as Alibaba\u2019s chief human-resources executive. She played an integral role in establishing Ant\u2019s corporate culture and overseeing the expansion of Alipay, which is used by more than 520 million people to pay for everything including groceries, movie tickets and utility bills.  Mr. Ma, in an internal email Monday, said that when Ms. Peng took the post of executive chairman of Lazada, \u201cLucy told me the time had come for Eric to take on even more responsibility and for her to step away and give Ant\u2019s leadership team the space to grow even faster.\u201d  Mr. Jing previously held other positions within Ant and Alipay, including chief operating officer, president and chief financial officer. He joined Alibaba in 2007 as a finance executive and started working at Alipay two years later.  Mr. Jing on Monday called Ms. Peng a mentor and said she was \u201cinstrumental in cultivating a world-class Ant Financial team\u201d that will stay true to its mission, according to Ant\u2019s statement.  Alibaba said in February that it would acquire about a one-third stake in Ant and end a profit-sharing agreement with the affiliate. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of this year.

The country\u2019s securities regulator has reached out to a number of state-owned investment banks to explore ways to let already-listed companies and private businesses issue shares on the mainland, according to investment bankers briefed on the discussions.  \u2018The government has a long-term plan to wean these companies off the U.S.\u2019 \u2014Paul Gillis, Peking University\u2019s Guanghua School of Management  One option being considered is to allow such companies to issue depositary receipts, so they can bypass Chinese law prohibiting firms incorporated overseas from going public on the mainland. The likes of Tencent and Alibaba are incorporated abroad in a special corporate structure so they can get around Chinese restrictions on foreigners investing in sectors like technology.  It is part of China\u2019s longer-term goal to turn the tide on years of the country\u2019s businesses going public overseas. Beijing would like to see more Chinese companies choose the mainland capital market as their primary listing destination eventually, the investment bankers said.  \u201cAt some point, it makes sense for Alibaba and Tencent to have their primary listings in China,\u201d said Paul Gillis, an accounting professor at Peking University\u2019s Guanghua School of Management. \u201cThe government has a long-term plan to wean these companies off the U.S.\u201d  \u201cThis would be a step in that direction,\u201d he said.  Tencent and Alibaba are already among the world\u2019s most valuable companies, and China has earmarked frontier technologies such as artificial intelligence as important growth drivers for the country\u2019s economy.  Shares in Hong Kong-listed Tencent\u2014the owner of China\u2019s most popular messaging app, WeChat\u2014more than doubled last year. In the process Tencent became the first Chinese technology company to crack the $500 billion valuation club, joining industry titans such as Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc.  NYSE-listed shares of Alibaba, China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, almost doubled last year. Alibaba now has a market capitalization of more than $460 billion.  In recent days, a number of tech companies said they are open to a China listing, though executives haven\u2019t gone into details. Tencent Chief Executive Pony Ma said the company would \u201cactively consider\u201d listing inside China. Baidu Inc. Chairman Robin Li said recently that the search-engine company has \u201calways wanted to come home to China.\u201d Richard Liu, chairman of Nasdaq-listed e-commerce company JD.com Inc., said \u201cif the authorities allow it, we are willing.\u201d The executives were speaking on the sidelines of China\u2019s annual legislative meetings, currently taking place in Beijing.  Chinese technology firms have in the past often opted for overseas listings, many in the U.S., for the prestige and to benefit from rules allowing dual-class share structures that give company owners more control over the business. The Chinese regulator\u2019s tough listing rules, such as the requirement for companies to be profitable for three years before listing, have also deterred high-growth technology firms from seeking direct share sales at home.  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Chinese regulators have already approached smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp., which has plans to go public in Hong Kong. Investors say it would be sensible for China\u2019s technology companies to list at home, given the brand awareness they command there and the likelihood their shares would trade at high valuations.  Still, analysts have some concerns. Depending on how contracts are drawn up, Chinese individual investors buying depository receipts could lack full shareholder rights, they say. The listings of a few hot names could also fuel speculation by Chinese individual investors, who dominate trading on the mainland.  \u201cWhen the government is supporting something, everyone rushes in,\u201d said T.J. Wong, a professor of business administration and accounting at the University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t want is a huge bubble, then a burst.\u201d  Chinese companies often have to wait years before getting approval from the market regulator to list their shares. The authorities would likely expedite this process for some tech firms, the investment bankers said.  Letting a number of top-quality companies issue shares on the mainland could help the Chinese market mature, analysts said. Beijing\u2019s goal, said one foreign banker, is to \u201ctake the winners.\u201d  It isn\u2019t clear when the regulator would formally invite specific companies into its market, given that changes to Chinese securities law would need high-level leadership approval.  \u2014Yoko Kubota contributed to this article.
