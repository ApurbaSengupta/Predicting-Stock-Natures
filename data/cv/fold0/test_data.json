FILE PHOTO: An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City, July 21, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar  Apple said it had appointed Oliver Schusser as vice president of Apple Music and international content. Schusser, who joined Apple 14 years ago, will report directly to Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue and will also oversee Apple\u2019s services outside the United States, including the App Store and iTunes.  Apple\u2019s top streaming music rival Spotify Technology SA has 71 million so-called premium subscribers, a figure that includes users who have given the company a credit card number for a free trial. Spotify became a public company earlier this month after holding a so-called direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange.  On a comparable basis, the Apple Music service has 48 million subscribers, 40 million of whom are paying subscribers and 8 million of whom are on a free trial, Apple said. Both firms charge $9.99 a month for streaming music but provide discounts for student and family plans.  Variety magazine earlier reported the new subscriber figures and Schusser\u2019s promotion. He previously built up Apple\u2019s services businesses outside the U.S. in 155 markets, including China, Japan and Latin America, Apple said.  Apple\u2019s services business, which includes Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud, is becoming increasingly important to the Apple\u2019s financial outlook because the smart phone market has matured and iPhone sales growth has slowed. In its most recent quarter, Apple\u2019s services business grew 18 percent to $8.4 billion, missing analyst expectations of $8.6 billion.

The EU decision is the latest in a series by global regulators that have amounted to billions of dollars in fines and require changes in Qualcomm business. The contract at issue with Apple is no longer in force, and Qualcomm already faces more competition from Intel and other rivals.  Still, the EU decision could make Qualcomm more vulnerable to chipmaker Broadcom Ltd\u2019s $103 billion hostile bid, since Broadcom argues it can smooth rocky relations with customers such as Apple..  Qualcomm said it would appeal the decision immediately.  The European Commission said its investigation, launched in 2015, covered the period from 2011 to 2016 and took into account Qualcomm\u2019s market dominance in LTE baseband chipsets, which enable rapid mobile broadband connections.  \u201cQualcomm paid billions of U.S. dollars to a key customer, Apple, so that it would not buy from rivals. These payments were not just reductions in price \u2013 they were made on the condition that Apple would exclusively use Qualcomm\u2019s baseband chipsets in all its iPhones and iPads,\u201d European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.  \u201cThis meant that no rival could effectively challenge Qualcomm in this market, no matter how good their products were,\u201d she said.  The fine represented 4.9 percent of Qualcomm\u2019s 2017 turnover, the Commission said.  Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement that the company believed its agreement with Apple did not violate EU rules. \u201cWe have a strong case for judicial review and we will immediately commence that process,\u201d he said.  Qualcomm\u2019s shares were down 1.35 percent at $67.42 in midday trade, and analysts saw the fine as good for Broadcom\u2019s approach.  \u201cWhile Qualcomm believes they are in a temporary (albeit perfect) storm of customer and regulatory issues, Broadcom believes that the current problems are a harbinger of further headwinds to come,\u201d Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein, said in a note to clients Wednesday. \u201cAnd this latest finding continues to support the idea that regulators remain unhappy with the current state of affairs.\u201d  Despite levying fines, EU antitrust regulators recently cleared Qualcomm\u2019s $38 billion bid to buy NXP Semiconductors. Chinese regulators still need to approve the deal, and some NXP shareholders want a higher price.  Qualcomm is required to post a bond for the fine while the appeal unfolds, which will likely result in a charge for the current quarter. When hit with fines in the past, such as $774 million levy last year from Taiwanese regulators, Qualcomm took a charge as it appealed.  RELATIONS WITH APPLE STRAINED  Vestager told a news conference there would be no repercussions for Apple in the case.  EU antitrust regulators have come under pressure after European judges sent a case against U.S. chipmaker Intel back to an EU court for an appeal. Intel was fined 1 billion euros in 2009 for paying computer makers to buy most of their chips from them.  Google has also appealed against a record 2.4 billion euro fine for giving prominent placements in searches to its shopping service and demoting rival offerings.  This is the Commission\u2019s first decision on market abuse since the Intel ruling last September. Vestager said the ruling had given guidance on how to prove its case.  \u201cWe have carefully examined the ruling and the evidence in our case to make sure that our decision fully complies with the guidance given by the court,\u201d she said.  Apple and Qualcomm are meanwhile locked in a wide-ranging legal battle over Qualcomm\u2019s business practices, which started a year ago with Apple suing Qualcomm for nearly $1 billion in patent royalty rebates that the chipmaker allegedly withheld from the phone maker.  Other regulators, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, are also investigating Qualcomm\u2019s dealings with Apple. The EU competition enforcer is expected to rule in the coming months against Qualcomm in another case involving British phone software maker Icera, which was later acquired by Nvidia Corp, a person familiar with the matter has told Reuters.  In that case, Qualcomm is accused of selling chipsets below cost to drive out Icera - a practice known as predatory pricing.

Apple is looking to reassert dominance in U.S. schools, where inexpensive laptops running software from Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp now top iPad by sales, offering a cheap way to get to cloud-based productivity tools.  The new iPad has a more powerful computing chip and an extensive set of new, free software for teachers to manage students and schoolwork. But the unchanged starting price of $299 for students and $329 for the general public, without a keyboard or case, compares with less than $200 for some Windows and Google Chrome models.  Apple shares were down 1.4 percent to $170.26 after the event, slightly better than the NASDAQ Composite, which was down 1.6 percent in midday trading.  Some analysts had believed Apple might cut prices, but the company stuck with its more traditional approach of packing more features into a device.  Despite the new software, Apple faces a tough battle in the educational market given the popularity of Google and Microsoft\u2019s productivity suites, said Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies. Google\u2019s G Suite fueled Chromebook sales because it was seen as easy to use to manage assignments.  \u201cMost teachers don\u2019t look past G Suite for education,\u201d she said.  Apple, as part of its response, on Tuesday announced improvements in its iWork suite at an event in Chicago, where school bells and announcements over a public address system directed press and more than 300 teachers into an auditorium at Lane Tech College Prep High School.  The event came during a spring buying season when many schools are making purchasing decisions for the upcoming school year.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been at this for 40 years and we care deeply about education,\u201d Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said at the event.  Apple executives said the new iPad works with its pencil accessory and features an upgraded A10 Fusion chip, the same CPU that powers the iPhone 7. It is available immediately.  The Apple Pencil remains priced at $99 for the public and $89 for schools, though Lenovo will release a device called Crayon for $49, the first third-party stylus to work with the iPad.  Apple's Vice-President of iOS, iPad and iPhone Product Marketing, Greg Joswiak, speaks at an education-focused event at Lane Technical College Prep High School in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., March 27, 2018. REUTERS/John Gress  Apple made up just 17 percent of the K-12 U.S. educational market in the third quarter, according to data from Futuresource Consulting. Meanwhile 60 percent of mobile computing shipments to schools ran Google\u2019s Chrome and 22 percent had Windows.  Chromebooks sold by Dell Technologies Inc cost as little as $189. Microsoft last year introduced an education-focused laptop from Lenovo Group Ltd running Windows 10 S for a similar price.  Acer Inc announced a tablet that runs Chrome OS for $329 on Monday that comes with a built-in stylus.  Apple in recent years made changes to its operating system so that more than one student can log into an iPad, and to its software to let teachers better manage students.  On Tuesday it updated iWork - which includes word processing, spreadsheet and presentation software - to allow students to take handwritten notes more easily, along with adding more free storage on its iCloud service.  Apple also released a new app called Schoolwork to help teachers create assignments and track student progress. Google has a similar app for managing student profiles, but analysts highlighted Apple\u2019s Schoolwork app as unique in helping teachers manage assignments and progress.  The previously iPad-focused Classroom teacher administration app would start working on Mac computers in June, Apple said.  In the fall Apple will roll out \u201cEveryone Can Create\u201d lessons on video, photography, music, and drawing, joining existing \u201cEveryone Can Code\u201d guides for computer programming skills.  The new courses highlight features that some low-priced laptops do not have, such as a camera and microphone.  \u201cIf you look at it as a Chromebook competitor, it\u2019s expensive. But if you look at it and say, I can do music with GarageBand, I can take pictures or use it as a video camera and now I can do (augmented reality) ... it appeals to teachers and schools that want to push the envelope on education,\u201d Milanesi said.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo  At an annual shareholder meeting at Apple Park in Cupertino on Tuesday, Cook responded to a question on whether the company might double its dividend in the wake of changes to United States tax laws that allowed corporations to bring back overseas cash at lower tax rates than before.  \u201cSpecial dividends, I\u2019m not really a fan of,\u201d Cook responded. \u201cBut in terms of annual increases in the dividend, it is something that this board and management are committed to doing.\u201d  Cook said the company would provide an update on its capital return program during its April earnings call with investors, as it has done for the past several years.  At the meeting, shareholders defeated two shareholder proposals, one asking that rules allowing shareholders to nominate directors to the board be eased, and another asking for a human rights committee at Apple.  The proxy access measure asked Apple to reconsider its rules for shareholders to nominate directors; the rules say that a group of no more than 20 shareholders must hold 3 percent of Apple\u2019s stock in order to nominate a director for one of the eight director positions. The proposal did not pass, with 67.8 percent of shareholders voting against it.  Another proposal urged Apple to create a human rights panel to oversee issues such as workplace conditions and censorship in China and to report results back to the public. The proposal was defeated, with 94.4 percent of shareholders voting against it.  Apple had recommended that shareholders vote against both of the measures.  Shareholders approved four measures put forth by the company, including a required \u201csay on pay\u201d vote to approve pay for executives and a measure on re-electing the current directors.

REUTERS/Charles Platiau  Wall Street\u2019s optimism about last year\u2019s 10th anniversary iPhone had propelled Apple\u2019s stock 24 percent higher over the past 12 months, giving it a market capitalization of $893 billion.  That is $141 billion more than the $752 billion market value of Amazon, the world\u2019s third most valuable publicly listed company, but Amazon has been quickly closing the gap.  (For graphic on Market Capitalization: Apple vs Amazon.com vs Alphabet, click: reut.rs/2Fn9hzA)  Amazon\u2019s stock has surged 83 percent over the past year, bolstered by scorchingly fast revenue growth as more shopping moves online and businesses shift their computing operations to the cloud, where Amazon Web Services leads the market.  In January, Amazon announced that it, Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co would form a company to cut health care costs for their employees, which was widely seen as a threat to the existing U.S. healthcare system and underscored Amazon\u2019s ability to disrupt markets.  Amazon dislodged Microsoft Corp as the No. 3 U.S. company by market capitalization in February.  At $783 billion, Alphabet Inc has the second largest market capitalization. The Google parent company\u2019s stock has grown about 33 percent over the past year, faster than Apple but far slower than Amazon.  Meanwhile, optimism about Apple\u2019s iPhone X has given way to concerns that demand for the $1,000 device may be weaker than expected.  To be sure, past stock gains are not a reliable predictor of future performance, and the surge in Amazon shares in recent years has been exceptional by most standards.  But if Amazon\u2019s stock were to keep growing on the trajectory seen over the past year, the company\u2019s market capitalization would hit $1 trillion in late August. Apple would reach $1 trillion around a week later if its stock price continued to rise at the same pace seen over the past year.  Alphabet would not reach $1 trillion until 2019 if its stock price continued to rise at the same pace seen over the past year.  (For graphic on race to $1 Trillion Market Cap, click: reut.rs/2DbhQYq)  Most Wall Street analysts are not quite that enthusiastic about the growth of Apple and Amazon. Analysts on average expect Apple\u2019s stock price to rise 11 percent and reach $195 within the next 12 months, which would put its market capitalization at $989 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Analysts covering Amazon on average expect its stock to rise 10 percent within the next year to reach $1,700, which would give it a market value of $823 billion.  Apple on Thursday was up 0.60 percent at $176.05, while Amazon rose 0.31 percent to $1,549.90.

VirnetX\u2019s stock rose as much as 44 percent on the news in after hours trading. The company closed at $4.10 per share on Tuesday.  Apple\u2019s stock has seen little change on the news given that the $502.6 million award is minuscule compared to the company\u2019s profits. The company generated $20 billion profit in the first quarter, the company said in February.  VirnetX claimed that Apple\u2019s FaceTime, VPN on Demand and iMessage features infringe four patents related to secure communications, claims that Apple denied.  The dispute has bounced between the district court, patent office and Federal Circuit since 2010. There have been multiple trials, most recently one involving earlier versions of the Apple devices. A jury in that case awarded $302 million that a judge later increased to $439.7 million.  Kendall Larsen , CEO of VirnetX, said the damages, which were based on sales of more than 400 million Apple devices, were \"fair.\"  \"The evidence was clear,\" Larsen said after the verdict was announced. \"Tell the truth and you don\u2019t have to worry about anything.\"  Apple lawyers declined to comment.  For VirnetX, the jury verdict in its favor could be a short-lived victory. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board has said the patents are invalid, in cases that are currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington.  The Federal Circuit, which handles all patent appeals, declined to put this trial on hold, saying it was so far along that a verdict would come before a final validity decision.  VirnetX, based in Zephyr Cove, Nevada, reported just over $1 million in revenue last year but investors have boosted the stock by more than 70 percent in hopes of an eventual victory over Apple.  The company started within government contractor SAIC Inc., tasked with developing secure communications for the Central Intelligence Agency. It was spun out with aspirations to be bought by Microsoft Corp. Instead, Microsoft paid it $200 million to end litigation in 2010, and then another $23 million for newer products.

Investors seeking to gauge demand for the iPhone last quarter got clues Wednesday from Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Ltd., two of Apple Inc.\u2019s biggest suppliers.  Both companies indicated that orders related to the iPhone tailed off more than normal at this time of year. That helped round out a flurry of reports in recent weeks that suggested demand for the flagship handset hasn\u2019t met rosy predictions, dragging on Apple\u2019s shares.  Qualcomm said that orders from a large customer tailed off at worse-than-typical levels in the quarter. San Diego-based Qualcomm didn\u2019t identify the company, but the remarks were widely interpreted as referring to Apple. Broadcom said it expects a \u201cgreater-than-seasonal decline in wireless\u201d components, indicating fewer-than-anticipated sales of its chips for its fiscal second quarter, which ends in April. Broadcom provides wireless network and Bluetooth components for the iPhone. Christopher Rolland, an analyst at Susquehanna Investment Group, pegged Apple as the reason for the order slowdown in a note Wednesday.  Apple reports earnings after the close of trading. Analysts have projected revenue of $84 billion to $87 billion for the holiday quarter, including from its new flagship iPhone X, which went on sale in November. However, supply chain reports have indicated that the Cupertino, California-based technology giant has cut iPhone X orders in half for early 2018. Multiple analysts also have said the iPhone X was not the holiday smash hit that some expected.  The company\u2019s stock gained 48 cents to $167.91 as of 1:30 p.m. in New York. Through Wednesday, it had declined 6.6 percent since reaching a record Jan. 18 as talk of an iPhone slump set in. BMO Capital Markets downgraded its rating on the stock Wednesday. Ming-Chi Kuo, at KGI Securities, recently warned that iPhone X sales weren\u2019t as strong as anticipated in China. JPMorgan wrote that \"demand has gone sour quickly,\" and a survey by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners found iPhone X models made up just a fifth of iPhone sales in the holiday quarter.  A smaller supplier, Qorvo Inc., predicted current quarter sales of as little as $645 million, missing analysts\u2019 estimates by more than $100 million. Qorvo makes radio-frequency chips and gets about 40 percent of its sales from Apple, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Apple declined to comment on the suppliers\u2019 forecasts.

The Cupertino, California-based company said revenue in the three months ending in March will be $60 billion to $62 billion. Analysts were looking for $65.9 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  For the final quarter of 2017, Apple said it sold 77.3 million iPhones, down 1 percent from a year earlier and below analysts\u2019 projections of 80.2 million units. The average selling price was $796 -- ahead of expectations -- suggesting its flagship iPhone X handset sold relatively well, while cheaper versions weren\u2019t as popular.  The numbers, which would be extraordinary for virtually any other company in the world, underscore the elevated expectations that investors have for Apple. They also highlight concern about lackluster demand for iPhones, sparked by recent reports of Apple cutting orders to suppliers and lower analyst estimates. Fewer new handsets means Apple has to work harder to sell related services, accessories and other devices. It also leaves less time for the company to create its next big hit, potentially in wearable technology, augmented reality or even transportation.  Apple reported fiscal first-quarter revenue of $88.3 billion, and profit of $3.89 a share, beating average analyst estimates.  Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the 2017 holiday period was a week shorter, compared with 2016, limiting iPhone sales. \"We are very, very happy with the guidance we are providing,\" he added, noting that sales of handsets were strong in all regions.  \"IPhone X was the most popular phone and since we launched it in early November, for every week it\u2019s been the top selling iPhone,\" Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in an interview. \"Couldn\u2019t be prouder of it.\"  Apple shares fell about 1 percent in extended trading, after closing at $167.78 in New York on Thursday. The stock had dropped about six percent in the days leading up to earnings.  The iPhone X, which went on sale in November, is available in $999 and $1,149 configurations, at least $150 more than any iPhone starting price that came before. The new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus handsets also start at $50 more than their predecessors. Those higher sticker prices buoyed ASPs and helped revenue in the holiday period.

The U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating whether Apple violated securities laws concerning its disclosures about a software update that slowed some handsets, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News on Tuesday. The U.S. government has requested information from the company, according to the people, who asked not to be named because the probe is private.  The inquiry is in early stages, they cautioned, and it\u2019s too soon to conclude any enforcement will follow. Investigators are looking into public statements made by Apple on the situation, they added. While the slowdown has frustrated consumers, investigators are concerned the company may have misled investors about the performance of older phones.  \"We have received questions from some government agencies and we are responding to them,\" an Apple spokeswoman said. She reiterated an earlier statement that the company \"never \u2014 and would never \u2014 do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades.\"  A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment.

Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg  Several weeks ago, Apple said a software update released in early 2017 slowed down the performance of older iPhones models as a way to avoid the phones shutting down at random. When it released the update, the company hadn\u2019t said the software would slow down the devices. In December, Apple apologized for not clearly communicating this information and vowed to release another update to mitigate the concern.  Earlier in January, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told ABC News that when the company put out the software update that caused the performance issues for older iPhones \u201cwe did say what it was, but I don\u2019t think a lot of people were paying attention. And maybe we should have been clearer.\u201d  The slowdowns occur when an older iPhone\u2019s battery reaches a certain, unspecified point of low health and can be fixed if a user replaces the battery. As part of its public apology, Apple cut the prices of battery replacements in its stores to $29, a $50 discount.  Apple plans to release an iPhone software update, called iOS 11.3, in the next few months with new features that let users monitor the health of their batteries and protect against slowdowns. If consumers turn off the throttling, older iPhones will be more prone to randomly rebooting, Apple has said. The system affects iPhone 7 models and older, but not the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, according to the company.  John Thune Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg  After apologizing to customers in December, Apple was sued by consumer advocacy groups and individual iPhone users in a global backlash. Government officials, including U.S. Senator John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, have also questioned Apple about the slowdowns.  \u201cEven if Apple\u2019s actions were indeed only intended to avoid unexpected shutdowns in older phones, the large volume of consumer criticism leveled against the company in light of its admission suggests that there should have been better transparency with respect to these practices,\u201d Thune wrote in a January letter to Cook.

Apple will be told to file the transaction to the Brussels-based antitrust authority, who will take over the merger review from Austria, where it was originally declared.  Big technology mergers involving startups with insignificant revenue usually fall through the EU\u2019s usual net for checking whether deals harm competition across the bloc. However, alarmed that it nearly missed Facebook Inc.\u2019s takeover of messaging service WhatsApp, the EU is seeking to change its rules to allow it to take charge of acquisitions where a target company makes no money but holds valuable technology or intellectual property.  Apple announced its purchase of the U.K.-based app in December, for a reported $400 million, according to people familiar with the transaction, which would make it one of Apple\u2019s largest acquisitions. The Shazam app uses the microphone on a smartphone or computer to identify almost any song playing nearby, then points users to places they can listen to it, such as Apple Music or Spotify Ltd.  The acquisition would help Apple embed that capability more deeply into its music offerings. The company\u2019s digital assistant Siri was integrated with Shazam in 2014, so users could ask it what song is playing in the background.  The EU may be worried that once Shazam is under Apple\u2019s control, the iPhone maker could choose to make Apple Music the only option for listening to tracks. That could divert some of the referrals from Shazam that currently go to London-based Spotify. The acquisition also gives Apple access to a large user data base of people\u2019s musical interests.  Apple hasn\u2019t indicated that it plans to make Shazam an exclusive for Apple Music, but in the past the company has sometimes made acquired features compatible only with its products. It also has sometimes kept support for properties it\u2019s bought, for example, when Cupertino, California-based Apple acquired Beats Music to develop Apple Music, Apple released an Android version of the program.  Apple said it would work with the EU on the matter, but declined to provide further detail. The EU took up the review after Austria, Iceland, Italy, France, Norway, Spain and Sweden all asked it to do so.  The EU reviewed and approved the Facebook-WhatsApp deal after several European authorities asked the commission to step in. Facebook was later fined for misleading the EU during the merger probe. It had told the regulators it couldn\u2019t combine WhatsApp data with its other services but moved to do so shortly after the deal was finalized.  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Gurman", "stock": "AAPL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-06", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-06/apple-shazam-deal-may-threaten-competition-in-europe-eu-says"}, {"article": "Apple Inc.

The iPhone maker plans capital expenditures of $30 billion in the U.S. over five years and will create 20,000 new jobs at existing sites and a new campus it intends to open. The Cupertino, California-based company\u2019s shares rose 1.7 percent to a record closing price of $179.10.  \u201cWe are focusing our investments in areas where we can have a direct impact on job creation and job preparedness,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in a statement Wednesday, which also alluded to unspecified plans by the company to accelerate education programs.  Apple also told employees Wednesday that it\u2019s issuing stock-based bonuses worth $2,500 each following the new U.S. tax law, according to people familiar with the matter.  In its December approval of the most extensive tax-code revisions since 1986, Congress scrapped the previous international tax system for corporations -- an unusual arrangement that allowed companies to defer U.S. income taxes on foreign earnings until they returned the income to the U.S. That \u201cdeferral\u201d provision led companies to stockpile an estimated $3.1 trillion offshore and many were criticized for the moves, including Apple.  By switching to a new system that\u2019s designed to focus on domestic economic activity, congressional tax writers also imposed a two-tiered levy on that accumulated foreign income: Cash will be taxed at 15.5 percent, less liquid assets at 8 percent. Companies can pay over eight years.  New Jobs  Apple is the first major U.S. technology company to act on the new tax law and it joins others, such as Intel Corp., in responding to criticism by President Donald Trump and others that corporations have been ignoring American workers and manufacturing. Job creation was a key pillar of Trump\u2019s election campaign. That means the new positions created by Apple are likely to have a more significant political impact than its $38 billion tax payment, according to Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business.  \u201cThe thrust here is American jobs, jobs on American soil, build manufacturing here, don\u2019t build everything in China,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have an announcement of a million jobs. But you can have companies like Apple saying that we\u2019re going to have 20,000 new jobs here. If other companies say they\u2019re going to have new jobs too, it does add up.\u201d  For more on Apple, check out the Decrypted podcast:  Later Wednesday, Trump tweeted a response lauding Apple\u2019s announcement. \u201cI promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGreat to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS. Huge win for American workers and the USA!\u201d  Apple has the largest offshore cash reserves of any U.S. company, with about $252 billion at the end of September, the most recently reported fiscal quarter. The tax rate indicates that Apple is likely bringing back a majority of its overseas cash back to the U.S., leaving only a small portion for international investments like retail stores.  \u201cThey\u2019re going to have well over $200 billion by the end of this year that will be available for incremental investments, capital returns and M&A,\u201d said Matthew Kanterman, a New York-based Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. The new tax law lets U.S. companies bring overseas cash reserves back home in one year and pay the resulting tax bill over eight years. \u201cAnd Apple hasn\u2019t historically done big M&A,\u201d he said.  Five-Year Spending Plan  The $30 billion in capital expenditures will come as part of $350 billion that Apple expects to spend in the U.S. over the next five years. The 20,000 new jobs include additional Apple employees at its campuses, data centers, and retail stores, but not third-party developers for iPhone and Mac apps, an economy Apple has touted in the past.  Apple said that part of the $30 billion in capital expenditures will go toward a new U.S.-based campus, new data centers and additional supplier investments. The company, which opened a new headquarters in Cupertino last year, said its new U.S. site initially will be focused on employees who provide technical support to Apple product users. The new location, which Apple said it will announce later this year, will be similar to the company\u2019s existing campus in Austin, Texas, for supply-chain and technical-support employees.  Can This Tax Proposal Lure Companies and Cash Home?: QuickTake  Apple said it will increase its local manufacturing fund, announced last year, from $1 billion to $5 billion, indicating that it will be sourcing more components for its products domestically. As part of the original fund, Apple invested in Corning Inc. and Finisar Corp., companies that make components for iPhone glass screens and lasers for Face ID and AirPods, respectively.  \u201cThese are probably many capital expenditure initiatives and new site build-outs that Apple was already planning on doing regardless of repatriation,\u201d said Michael Olson, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock.  \u201cWhat\u2019s not said in this release is that there is more potential for increased buybacks for shareholders and acquisitions that might not have taken place if it were not for the cash influx from overseas,\u201d Olson said.

The headphones, internally known as B288, will include an upgraded Apple-designed wireless chip for managing Bluetooth connections. The first AirPods include a chip known as the W1, and Apple released the W2 with the Apple Watch last year.

A day after, Cook said he \"wouldn\u2019t be in this situation\" if he were in Zuckerberg\u2019s shoes, in an interview with Recode and MSNBC. While Facebook makes money selling targeted advertisements based on user data, Apple\u2019s profit comes from hardware products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

As everything from refrigerators to self-driving cars throw off information that needs to be uploaded to the cloud, data centers will be housing 1.3 zettabytes (1.3 trillion gigabytes) by 2021, more than double from this year, according to Cisco Systems Inc..

How is business?  The demand for ball bearings is very strong and we\u2019re increasingly eating through our inventory. Demand from data centers in particular is very strong. We\u2019re quite surprised by growth of fan motors for cooling data centers. It\u2019s not enough to have one data center, but you need backups. And then a backup for your backup. The data you see on Instagram and other services, that keeps increasing. People aren\u2019t deleting their photos. And we\u2019re very thankful for that.  Are you planning more investment?  We still have capacity to increase by 15 million bearings annually by using space in existing factories in Thailand, which will bring capacity to 300 million by May or June. But it is becoming necessary to invest in new factories. We\u2019re considering possible locations.  How much would you be willing to spend?  We\u2019ve already invested 8 billion yen in expanding capacity, but that was within existing locations. To build infrastructure for a brand-new factory requires a number that has an extra digit. That\u2019s why we have to consider it very seriously.  Will we see profits revised higher again?  I can\u2019t speak about short-term earnings, but when we laid out our medium-term plan last May we expected operating profit to reach 100 billion yen by March 2021. It\u2019s beginning to look like we can arrive at that number a year early.  What\u2019s the outlook for the game-console assembly business?  Our customer is doing very well. We won\u2019t know next fiscal year\u2019s numbers until March. But we\u2019re not a supplier, we\u2019re an assembler. We can deal with bigger demand and won\u2019t need additional investment.

Apple said the base expanded 30 percent from two years ago to 1.3 billion.  That increase should have been seen as positive because Apple aims to become less dependent on selling iPhones and shift to selling its existing customers services like Apple Music or add-on devices like the Apple Watch or AirPods.  But analysts voiced skepticism. Apple's best-selling product, the iPhone, has seen relatively flat unit sales over the same two-year period. On Apple's earnings conference call, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said that the combination of trends implies users are hanging on to their devices longer, and he asked Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook whether investors should be worried about that.  Cook responded that it was up to investors to decide what to focus on, but said he was comfortable with customers buying used iPhones.  When customers sell their old iPhone for a new one, the old iPhone \"winds up with another customer somewhere else that is perfectly fine with having a previously owned iPhone. And so I view all of that to be incredibly positive. It's more people on iPhones, the better,\" Cook said.  Laura Martin of Needham & Co pressed Cook on whether the larger device base meant more devices per user, or more users - an important question, because a user with both an iPad and iPhone is likely to only purchase one Apple Music subscription, for example.  Cook said \"there are many, many, many more\" Apple users than two years ago but declined to give an actual figure.  The signals on how well Apple is monetizing users were mixed. Sales of its \"wearable\" accessories - Beats headphones, AirPods and the Apple Watch - were up 70 percent year-over-year in the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 30. But services revenue - which includes Apple Music, iCloud and the App Store - fell short of analysts' expectations for the December quarter, at $8.4 billion, and was down slightly from the previous quarter.  Apple has yet to disclose plans for how it will distribute the television shows in which it has been investing in recent months, which could become a large business.  \"They've been building up the services business for several years, knowing full well that at some point the gravy train on smart phones is going to end,\" said Bob O'Donnell, head of Technalysis Research.

Apple runs one of the largest manufacturing chains in the world, but most of the work is done at factories owned by contractors.  Apple audited 756 suppliers in 30 countries, 197 of which it was auditing for the first time.  Apple said in its annual supplier responsibility report that the proportion of \"low performers,\" or suppliers scoring less than 59 points on its 100-point scale, fell to 1 percent in 2017 from 3 percent in 2016 and 14 percent in 2014. \"High performers\" with scores of more than 90 rose to a record high of 59 percent from 47 percent the year before.  Apple found 44 so-called \"core violations\" of its labor rules in 2017, double the previous year. Those included three instances of employees forced to pay excessive fees for a job, a practice Apple banned in 2015.  In one case, over 700 foreign contract workers recruited from the Philippines were charged a total of $1 million to work for a supplier. Apple said it forced the supplier to repay the money.  Compliance with Apple's 60-hour work week fell to 94 percent of suppliers from 98 percent the year before. Moreover, Apple said it uncovered 38 cases of falsification of working hours data in 2017, up from 9 cases the year before.  Apple said the increase was driven by the fact that it brought on a number of new suppliers in 2017 and started tracking the working hours data of 1.3 million supplier employees, 30 percent more than in previous years.  In the report, Apple also said it was launching a new women's' health initiative at its supplier plants, with a goal of reaching 1 million women by 2020. And it said that it had launched a program in China to train workers to become factory line leaders, who often make 20 percent to 30 percent more than line workers.  On Wednesday, Apple also issued its so-called conflict minerals report, which is required by United States securities regulators. The report lists suppliers of sensitive metals such as tin and gold.  Apple company said that 16 smelters and refiners left its supply chain in 2017, 10 of which were dropped because they would not participate in a third-party audit of their practices. Six left of their own accord.  Apple also outlined new rules on student labor after a discovery last year that some Chinese students were working more than 11 hours a day assembling its iPhone X.

An Apple spokesman confirmed that the company does not plan to hold a bidding process for the new campus, after Apple chief executive Tim Cook said on Wednesday that he did not want \"an \"auction kind of process.\"  Apple's new campus is unlikely to be located in California, where the tech company's headquarters are housed at its sleek \"spaceship\" Apple Park campus in Cupertino, or in Texas, where it has facilities in Austin that house customer service and some computer assembly operations, said Cook in an interview with ABC News on Wednesday.  \"We've narrowed the list a lot,\" Cook said of potential sites. \"We wanted to narrow it so we prevent this auction kind of process that we want to stay out of.\"  Apple announced plans for a new site on Wednesday, along with a 5-year, $30 billion U.S. spending plan that will generate 20,000 jobs and an expected payment of $38 billion in taxes on its foreign profits.

Apple shares were down about 1.4 percent at $165.42 in early trade on Friday.  The iPhone X was the first phone to get a major design overhaul since the launch of the iPhone 6 in 2015, and many expected it to lead to blockbuster sales.  On Thursday, the Cupertino-based tech giant said it sold fewer iPhones over the holiday quarter than Wall Street expected, and sees revenue of $60 billion to $62 billion and gross margins of between 38 percent and 38.5 percent for its fiscal second quarter ending in March.  Analysts were expecting $65.7 billion in sales and a gross margin of 38.9 percent for the March quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Analysts at Longbow Research said the revenue guidance implied a low 50 million iPhone shipment forecast against a consensus of 58.5 million.  \"We now forecast 221 million iPhone shipments for fiscal 2018, versus the prior 235 million consensus.\"  On Thursday, Apple also said it was planning, over time, to \"target a capital structure that is approximately net neutral,\" adding that it will \"take that balance down from $163 billion to zero,\" referring to Apple's level of cash net of debt.  The comments sent its shares up about 3 percent Thursday after the bell.  \"iPhone sell-through appears to have declined in the December quarter, which, along with weaker-than-expected  second quarter revenue guidance, reinforces our view of a saturated market,\" KeyBanc analysts said in a note, cutting the rating on the stock to \"sector weight\" from \"overweight.\"\"Further, gross margin results and guidance both missed our expectations, which reduces our view of potential profit growth going forward.\"  Of 39 analysts who cover the stock, 29 rate it 'buy' or higher.

Major technology companies are battling for dominance in U.S. schools, a market seen as important for hooking young consumers.  Apple in March 2017 lowered the price of its 9.7-inch tablet to $329, the lowest starting price ever for one of its full-sized tablets. But laptops running operating systems by Alphabet Inc's Google or Microsoft Corp can be had for less than $200.  Apple's previous price cutting, along with software changes, have been followed by an improvement in iPad sales. Analysts believe the teacher- and student-geared event on Tuesday at Lane Tech College Prep High School will include an update to its iPad lineup, including possibly a lower-priced model.  Apple made up just 17 percent of the K-12 U.S. educational market in the third quarter, according to data from Futuresource Consulting. Meanwhile 60 percent of mobile computing shipments to schools ran Google's Chrome operating system, and 22 percent had Windows.  Chromebooks sold by Dell Technologies Inc can be had for as little as $189. Microsoft last year introduced an education-focused laptop from partner Lenovo Group Ltd running Window 10 S.  Apple in recent years made changes to its operating system so that more than one student can log into an iPad, and to its software to let teachers better manage groups of students.  But it faces a tough battle in the educational market given the popularity of Google and Microsoft's cloud-based productivity suites, said Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies. Google's G Suite fueled Chromebook sales because it was seen as easy to use to manage assignments.  \"Most teachers don't look past G Suite for education,\" she said. Apple has iWork, which added features in recent years but remains less familiar to teachers than Google's productivity suite or Microsoft's Office.  Education sales for iPads rose 32 percent to more than 1 million units in Apple's fiscal third quarter. Sales of iPads made up just 8.3 percent of Apple's $229.2 billion total revenue last year, however, compared with the nearly 62 percent of sales generated by iPhones.  Apple needs to keep working to regain market share in schools to get children interested in its devices later on, said TECHnalysis Research founder Bob O'Donnell.  \"It's more about the psychology of driving long-term preference for the (Apple) platform.

In recent weeks, Wall Street analysts have come to a consensus that iPhone X sales were slower than previously expected for the first quarter that ended in December and may drop off sharply for the March quarter.  Analysts have lowered their expectations for Apple's second- quarter revenue guidance to as low as $60 billion from a previous average of $67 billion.  Combined with concerns about the impact of an imbroglio in which Apple acknowledged slowing down phones with worn-out batteries, the weak iPhone X performance has again raised the question of whether the company can keep up its rapid revenue growth without a new hit product.  With eight different iPhone models priced from $350 to $999 on sale over the holidays, Apple showed that it has moved decisively away from co-founder Jobs' tight lineup of premium-priced products and embraced an iPhone-for-everybody strategy.  Analysts are questioning whether Apple can boost its revenue even as iPhone sales essentially plateau.  \"Apple will have to answer the question of what's next,\" UBS analyst Steven Milunovich wrote in a note to investors. \"More services to monetize the base of one billion customers and eventually enhanced [augmented reality] capabilities may be part of the answer.\"  Analysts still expect Apple to post record revenue, hitting the top of its $87 billion guidance for the holiday quarter. But they have slashed revenue estimates for the March quarter and expect the company to sell fewer iPhones in fiscal 2018 than initially thought.  Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi predicted as few as 220 million iPhones will sell in fiscal 2018, just above the 216.7 million sold in 2017 and well below the 2015 peak of 231.2 million.  BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk spotlighted a steadily lengthening replacement cycle as new iPhones offer only small improvements over prior models. Now that it has become clear that a new battery can give life to an old phone, more customers may choose to delay an upgrade, especially with Apple cutting the price of a battery replacement to $29 from $79.  Analysts still believe Apple will report sales of $272.2 billion for its fiscal 2018, 18.7 percent above its $229.2 billion in fiscal 2017. That will be driven largely by higher average prices paid for iPhones, they said.  'WILD CARD'  But Apple does not give data on specific models, and with the wider lineup, analysts must do more guesswork based on surveys and other tools. They also find it harder to predict how much money Apple makes off each phone.  \"We believe that gross margins are a key wild card for investors, given limited transparency into relative margins across iPhone [models],\" Sacconaghi said in a note to investors.  All in all, it's a far cry from the days of Jobs, who shrank the company's product lineup when he returned to the helm in 1997 and kept it limited to a few models of each product at one time until his death in 2011.  But the Apple of today has something Jobs never had: An imposing user base into which it can sell a host of other products and services.  Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital and an Apple investor, believes Apple's services segment is the firm's next hit product. Analyst expect it to hit sales of $34.7 billion this year, up 16 percent.

Beck Diefenbach/Reuters  Apple acquired music recognition app Shazam in December for a reported $400 million.  It was clear Apple would integrate Shazam into its streaming service Apple Music \u2014 but neither company has given more detail.  Shazam's earliest big investor thinks Apple could get up to 7.5 million new Apple Music subscribers as a result of the deal \u2014 a nice bump to its existing 30 million subscribers.  Analyst Mark Mulligan said the acquisition is probably a combination of subscribers, plus the valuable data Shazam can give on what streaming services people use and what songs they really like.  To understand what Apple might do with its latest acquisition Shazam, you have to understand its evolving business model, according to early investor DN Capital.  The venture capital firm's chief executive, Nenad Marovac, first invested in Shazam in 2004, when its music recognition tech involved users dialling a number, holding up their phones to a source of music, then receiving an SMS \"tag\" which identified a song. Now, the song recognition is done through an app.  \"The way Shazam started off its business model was that after five [SMS] 'tags' you had to pay for it,\" said Marovac. \"Then it moved into lead-generation for MP3s, then it became an affiliate for streaming companies.\"  In other words, if you identified a song, then clicked a link inside Shazam to buy the song through iTunes, a cut of your payment would go to Shazam. But that became less profitable when streaming took off.  Apple once dominated music consumption, when people bought individual MP3 tracks through iTunes. Since the advent of Spotify, it hasn't kept up. Shazam might be a way to drive growth once again.  \"Since Apple has launched Apple Music, it's still a way behind the curve, behind Spotify,\" said Marovac. \"Shazam has 150 million active users a month, and about 300 million to 400 million uniques per year. If you convert 1% to 5% of those users to Apple Music, the investment will pay for itself in spades.\"  BI Graphics  Apple Music had 30 million paying subscribers, according to statistics released in September. Adding 5% of Shazam's base would add a maximum of 7.5 million paying users \u2014 a nice bump, but also best case scenario.  For long-time music industry watcher and Midia analyst Mark Mulligan, the deal is more than just generating paying users for Apple Music.  Apple really needs data to persuade people to use Apple Music more  Customer acquisition is one reason why Apple might have acquired Shazam, Mulligan told Business Insider. It's also likely Shazam will give Apple Music much needed new features that will keep users sticking around for longer, like Spotify's massively successful playlists.  \"Ultimately Apple will have relatively small concerns about how it will be able to acquire customers for Apple Music in the longer term,\" Mulligan said.  \"In relative terms, it's behind Spotify in terms of playlists and weekly active use,\" he added. \"Those are the metrics it needs to do more to drive. The Shazam dataset will be an important asset.\"  When you open the Shazam app and identify a song, you can then stream that song via Apple Music or rivals like Amazon Music and Spotify. That's valuable insight into how people are using other services.  \"It's a window into billions of data points about Shazam's Spotify, Amazon, and Deezer users, there's some value in that,\" said Mulligan. \"It really comes down \u2014 how short was the iTunes dataset coming up? If iTunes' data on a decade of user preferences wasn't good enough, then maybe Shazam was necessary.\"  Mulligan likened the Shazam acquisition to Spotify's purchase of Echo Nest, which now informs its massively successful playlists. It's the poor man's version though. \"To be frank, if I could choose between Shazam and Echo Nest, I'd pick Echo Nest any day,\" he said.  With so competition in music streaming, Shazam is also a signal that Apple is \"serious\" about music. \"Look at Yahoo,\" said Mulligan. \"That should have died off a decade ago, but they kept going by making big acquisitions that made people think Yahoo was serious. It used its increased market cap to then make another overpriced acquisition. There's a proven business model in making overpriced acquisitions to companies vaguely relevant to the space.\"", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-25", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-bought-shazam-for-new-subscribers-and-to-rival-spotifys-playlisting-tech-2018-1"}, {"article": "They include Ron Paprocki of Gotham Bar and Grill, a New York restaurant that since the 1980s has taken a structural approach to dishes, like its signature soaring chocolate cake; Rachel Gibeley of Rosebud American Kitchen & Bar in Boston, who oversees a celebrated pie program with creative flavors like grapefruit-caramel meringue; and Brandi Henderson, formerly of Delancey in Seattle, who now runs the adjacent cooking school and community kitchen, the Pantry.  Photo  The best known, though, is Dinara Kasko, a Ukrainian architect-turned-pastry chef who became an internet sensation last year for her sculptural, highly geometric desserts: a cherry cake made to look like shiny red bubbles encased in a cube, and a berry-almond tart with a mazelike surface, constructed with a mold made by a 3D printer.  The link between architecture and pastry dates back at least to 1815, when the renowned French chef Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame wrote \u201cLe Patissier Royal,\u201d a treatise that codified how architectural principles like drawing and planning could be applied in pastry. Chefs have long played with the structural possibilities of sugar, egg whites, flour and other ingredients.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But today, architectural values and technology are shaping the new norms for dessert. And while the results are carefully plotted and constructed, they are not always towering or eye-popping. In fact, this new school of pastry chefs is trying to rescue the dessert course from the outlandish unicorn cakes and mile-high ice cream sundaes that saturate Instagram.  Photo  \u201cYou have all these photos of desserts covered in rainbows and sparkles, and they might taste like sawdust, but no one knows, because it looks great on social media,\u201d lamented Jansen Chan, a former architect who is now the director of pastry at the International Culinary Center in New York and the Bay Area. \u201cInstagram is a great way for pastry chefs to communicate, but there\u2019s also the danger of people walking away from great pastry just because it\u2019s not totally visually driven.\u201d  Why have he and other chefs made such a radical career shift? In interviews, several said they realized while working in architecture that pastry required a similar skill set, and they found baking a cake a lot more interesting \u2014 and immediately gratifying \u2014 than designing a building.  Ms. Yee, 39, always wanted to be a pastry chef, but went to architecture school to placate her parents, who wanted her to have what she calls \u201ca real job.\u201d She landed a position at the San Francisco design firm Georgina Rice & Co., where she assisted in designing interiors, mostly for high-end apartments.  Photo  Tired of having to abide by mundane building codes and regulations, and wanting something more creative, she began studying pastry in 2002 at Le Cordon Bleu in London, while working as a pastry assistant at the Connaught hotel for the chefs Gordon Ramsay and Angela Hartnett.  She found that her architectural training applied in the pastry kitchen as well. \u201cBeing an architect is not all about the structure,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the intent. How will this improve someone\u2019s life?\u201d  \u201cDesserts are also about thoughtfulness,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat are the ways I can manipulate this apple? What will highlight what\u2019s grown here? It\u2019s about looking at your environment and seeing what will be functional and beautiful in that space.\u201d  Photo  Consider the \u00e9clair, Ms. Yee\u2019s signature dessert when she was the pastry chef at the French restaurant Lafayette in New York from 2013 to 2016.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u00c9clairs are highly technical, she said, vulnerable to everything from the level of protein in the flour to the type of oven you are using. The pastry can easily come out overly dry, or completely lose its oblong shape when baked.  But precision, for her, is only one priority. \u201cI wanted some element of spontaneity and approachability,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I garnished them, I would make the glaze a little wonky on the side, or cut the fruit on top in a random way.\u201d  Photo  That attentiveness runs through the sweet creations of Lisa Lu, 49, who oversaw the pastry department at the landmark San Francisco restaurant Boulevard from 2012 to 2017, and is now a production manager at the chocolate company Recchiuti Confections. Two decades ago, as an interior architect, she worked on creative projects like the American Licorice Company corporate headquarters in Bend, Ore., and a mock-up for a shop for the sports apparel brand UltraNectar, in the Bay Area.  \u201cHaving studied architecture,\u201d she said, \u201cI can put together a plated dessert because I understand composition \u2014 the need for balance and a focal point.\u201d  The lime tart she used to serve at Boulevard, like Ms. Yee\u2019s apple strudel, looks nothing like what a diner might expect. Ms. Lu balances a marrow-bone-shaped pastry shell filled with a tangy lime curd and pomegranate seeds on a plate, piping toasted meringue all around the tart, \u201cso that if a server wasn\u2019t careful when transporting the dessert, it would still be intact by the time it got to the table.\u201d The meringue acts like mortar, sealing the tart into place and giving the dessert stability.  Photo  \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of balance,\u201d Ms. Lu said. \u201cThe shell, which is designed to be open enough to be able to pipe in a curd, is the focal point. The meringue is piped in a few key areas, and then the scattered pomegranate seeds draw your eye around the plate and connect the whole dessert together.\u201d  To pastry chefs who learned the craft the old-fashioned way and don\u2019t work in the world of high-end restaurants, that kind of talk can sound like an overly cerebral or pretentious way to describe something simple: the joy of creating something sweet.  Stella Parks, a senior editor at Serious Eats and the author of the classic American dessert cookbook \u201cBraveTart,\u201d sees some good in the architectural influence on pastry, noting that it has brought more rigor into the practice.  Photo  \u201cMy worry,\u201d she added, \u201cis always that the culinary element is being forgotten. I have had so many meals at high-end restaurants that were extremely memorable, but more like a trip to a modern art museum, where you would never want those kinds of things in your own home.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Agatha Kulaga, a self-taught baker and a founder of the New York City bakery Ovenly, agreed; architectural ideals, she said, often leave out a vital element: nostalgia.  \u201cThe usefulness of an architecture background really depends on the end goal,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can have a dessert made by a pastry chef that feels like looking at a work of art \u2014 or you can have a dessert like a cookie or a slice of cake that doesn\u2019t necessarily feel like art, but creates an experience of joy.\u201d  Photo  But Baruch Ellsworth, the pastry chef at Canlis, in Seattle, who studied architecture at a California community college, said elements like taste and emotion are essential components of the architectural pastry practice. The difference is that they are incorporated more methodically.  Both pastry and architecture, he said, are an equation: \u201cA and B always have to equal C. You can tweak A and B lots of times, but it has to add up. You can\u2019t wing it.\u201d In other words, you can be as creative as you want in your choice of flavors of ingredients, but in the end, the dessert has to be something that people will want to eat, \u201cjust like when you make a building: you can do anything as long as it won\u2019t fall down.\u201d  One of his most popular desserts explores the kaleidoscopic, shape-shifting nature of chocolate. On a single plate, there\u2019s a tobacco-infused chocolate mousse, a Madagascar chocolate brownie, a milk chocolate crisp, a cocoa nib brittle, a caramel cream with caramelized white chocolate, and white chocolate streusel \u2014 all covered in a dehydrated layer of chocolate that elegantly drapes over each component like a silk sheet.  Photo  Mr. Ellsworth compared desserts like that to the Guggenheim Museum in New York. \u201cAt first, you\u2019re like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is a building,\u2019 because the outside looks like a tornado,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you go inside, you realize it is quite functional.\u201d  At the International Culinary Center in California and New York, known for turning out acclaimed pastry chefs like Christina Tosi, of Milk Bar, and Melissa Weller, the founder of Sadelle\u2019s bakery in SoHo, architecture plays a significant role in the curriculum, thanks to Mr. Chan, 42, and his architectural background.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Since 2015, the second half of the school\u2019s six-month pastry program has incorporated lessons on sketching, making timelines and project planning. Mr. Chan added a chapter called \u201cElements of Design\u201d to the school\u2019s textbook; it teaches students about architectural principles like dynamism and scale in relation to dessert.  Photo  Mr. Chan said a number of students have recently come to the school from the architecture world. \u201cThey have a much easier time at adapting because they are used to being asked questions. They are better able to express their creative ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cPastry students with no design backgrounds will be the ones to draw a tall chocolate structure with nothing holding it up.\u201d  Mr. Chan has also introduced technology into pastry education \u2014 tools like lasers, which can be used to bake and pipe batter at the same time, and water-jet cutters, used by architects to slice through sheet metal and by large-scale patisseries and hotels for cutting cakes into precise, programmed shapes in the half the time it would take a person to complete.  Not everyone endorses this approach, though. \u201cArchitecture and pastry are both very human schools of thought,\u201d said Ms. Yee, who makes the un-strudel-like strudel. \u201cYou are always thinking about what people will like. This kind of technology, to me, dehumanizes food. You\u2019re taking away the personal aspect of cooking.\u201d  Some blame technology for the glorification of social-media oddities like clear pumpkin pie, or ice cream wrapped in a cloud of cotton candy.  Mr. Chan recalled encountering a red velvet cake at a bakery in Thailand on a recent trip.  \u201cIt resembled a red velvet cake,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t have any cocoa. Someone had seen it online but didn\u2019t take the time to look up what, actually, is in a red velvet cake. That\u2019s the problem with social media. You lose context.

When news broke Monday that Mr. Giannandrea was unexpectedly stepping down as Google\u2019s A.I. chief, he immediately became perhaps the most eligible tech executive on the market. By Tuesday, it became clear he was never really on the market.  Apple has made other high-profile hires in the field, including the Carnegie Mellon professor Russ Salakhutdinov. Mr. Salakhutdinov studied at the University of Toronto under Geoffrey Hinton, who helps oversee the Google Brain lab.  Apple has taken a strong stance on protecting the privacy of people who use its devices and online services, which could put it at a disadvantage when building services using neural networks.  Researchers train these systems by pooling enormous amounts of digital data, sometimes from customer services. Apple, however, has said it is developing methods that would allow it to train these algorithms without compromising privacy.  On the debate over whether humanity should be worried about the rapidly accelerating improvements in A.I., Mr. Giannandrea told MIT Technology Review in an interview last year that the concerns were overblown.  \u201cWhat I object to is this assumption that we will leap to some kind of superintelligent system that will then make humans obsolete,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand why people are concerned about it but I think it\u2019s gotten way too much airtime.

Baird & Company, wrote in a research report.  While Amazon\u2019s online store sales grew 20 percent from a year earlier, the company\u2019s total retail growth benefited from its acquisition of Whole Foods Markets. That deal, announced in June, added much of the $4.52 billion in physical store revenue for the quarter.  Yet the biggest revenue growth came from a category generically named \u201cother,\u201d which includes advertising services and rose 62 percent to $1.74 billion from a year earlier.  By far the most profitable big business for the company was Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing unit. Its revenue rose 45 percent to $5.11 billion, and its operating income increased 46 percent to $1.35 billion.  Amazon kept with its tradition of secrecy by refusing to reveal exactly how many of its Echo family of devices it sold, saying only that it sold \u201ctens of millions\u201d of them last year. The company priced the devices aggressively over the holidays \u2014 its cheapest was only $29. The devices probably did not yield much profit, though they are an important part of Amazon\u2019s effort to establish a technology ecosystem that could result in other benefits, such as enabling customers to make impulse purchases with their voices.

For the company\u2019s fiscal first quarter, it reported a record for quarterly net income \u2014 $20.07 billion, up 12 percent from a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent to $88.3 billion. The gains were notable considering that Apple\u2019s fiscal first quarter was a week shorter than the previous year\u2019s 14-week fiscal first quarter.  While Amazon is content to price its devices near its costs for making them, Apple is known for charging a premium for its smartphones, tablets and computers. The iPhone X, which uses facial recognition to unlock the device, is the most expensive in its history, starting at almost $1,000.

Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on the company\u2019s earnings call.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Cook noted that the iPhone X was the company\u2019s top-selling phone in the quarter despite its November release, roughly a month and a half after Apple\u2019s other new iPhones.  The company sold 77.3 million iPhones over the quarter, which was down 1 percent from the longer quarter a year earlier. Yet revenue was higher largely because of the pricing of the new iPhones: In addition to introducing the iPhone X, Apple raised the price of the base model of its iPhone to $699, up from the $649 starting price for past iPhones.  Sales in its \u201cother products\u201d category, which includes the Apple Watch, grew 36 percent to $5.5 billion. Apple declined to disclose sales of the Apple Watch for competitive reasons, but Mr. Cook noted on the earnings call that revenue for the Apple Watch had grown 50 percent.  Apple also highlighted money generated from services, which include the App Store and Apple Music, with revenue rising 18 percent to $8.5 billion. Apple said the App Store continued to be the top destination for smartphone customers to buy apps.  Apple sold 13.2 million iPads, up 1 percent \u2014 notable because iPad sales declined for many consecutive quarters over the last few years. But Mac sales shrank about 5 percent to 5.1 million units.  Despite strong sales of the pricey iPhone X, some analysts remained concerned that its sales were slowing. Ahead of the earnings call, some news reports said Apple was slashing production of the iPhone X for the quarter that ends in March. The reports cited supply chain partners that said Apple had cut orders for parts.  But in years past, Apple has warned investors that activities of its complex supply chain were an unreliable metric for overall sales. The company also typically slows down iPhone production after the holiday quarter, which is the peak shopping season.  Last month, Apple also unveiled plans to bring the vast majority of its $252 billion in cash held abroad back to the United States, paying a one-time repatriation tax of $38 billion. Because the company had already earmarked $36.4 billion in anticipation that it would eventually have to pay taxes on its foreign earnings, Apple did not see much impact from the recent tax code changes.

Photo  A reality check on the White House\u2019s tariff tactics  Investors last week looked at President Trump\u2019s tariffs against Chinese products and seemed to conclude that he was taking the U.S. into a trade war with China. The stock market plunged 6 percent.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Perhaps eager to stop the rout, the White House on Monday had a less confrontational message: Mr. Trump is applying one of his negotiating tactics. According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer.  From a CNBC interview with Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers:  \u201cFrom the beginning, all the way back to last summer when I arrived at the White House, the president has been clear that he wants to set a marker down with some big asks at the beginning, he doesn\u2019t want to dribble them out, and then he wants his negotiators to try to fix the trade problems. ...Hopefully, it all works out with negotiation.\u201d  Mr. Hassett\u2019s comments were in response to a WSJ article reporting that China and the U.S. were quietly engaged in trade negotiations.  Investors seemed somewhat relieved: The stock market was up 1.5 percent on Monday. Of course, if the stakes are small enough, a deal may get done in the coming months that allows both sides to claim victory. But it seems unlikely that China would quickly agree to a far-reaching overhaul of the rules that govern foreign investment in the country, a major area of dispute. Our colleagues Raymond Zhong and Paul Mozur showed the depth of the divide there.  Mr. Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably. That could roil the markets again. The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride. Mr. Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell-offs as it pursues its trade agenda.  \u201cIf you start from a world where a bunch your intellectual technology is being stolen, then of course it\u2019s going to increase risk premiums in the short run when you try to do something about it, but in the end it should be a positive for us if we can get them to just stop them disregarding the rules of international order.\u201d  (Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks. This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers.)  Still, the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell-off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full-on trade war.  \u2014 Peter Eavis  Shares of Facebook continue to slide.  The stock is down 6.5 percent Monday morning as the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it has opened an investigation into Facebook\u2019s privacy practice.

Facebook\u2019s shares are down nearly 22 percent since its high in early February and off more than 18 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke more than a week ago.  To put Facebook\u2019s recent tumble in perspective: The stock is set for its worst monthly performance since August 2012. Over the past 10 days, Facebook has lost $100 billion in market value.  Despite the fall, Wall Street has not soured on Facebook. Forty-four analysts have buy ratings on the stock, compare to just two who have sell ratings, according to Bloomberg.  Photo  Tim Cook thinks regulation of Facebook is inevitable  The Apple C.E.O. said at the China Development Forum in Beijing that the government should tighten privacy regulations, after last week\u2019s revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica:  \u201cI think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary. The ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life \u2014 from my own point of view, it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d  Apple often uses privacy as a selling point, but Mr. Cook wasn\u2019t the only critic. Elon Musk deleted SpaceX and Tesla\u2019s Facebook pages, saying that the Tesla one \u201clooks lame anyway.\u201d Sir Martin Sorrell of the ad giant WPP said Facebook needed to \u201cstep up to the mark\u201d and be responsible for content on its platform. And some companies have stopped buying ads on Facebook, highlighting how advertisers want more transparency about performance. (Users also complained that the Android app tracked calls and text messages.)  Meanwhile, Facebook took out full-page ads in several British and American newspapers \u2014 including the NYT \u2014 for an apology signed by Mark Zuckerberg.  Elsewhere in Cambridge Analytica news: A volunteer for the campaign for Britain to leave the E.U. said that a Canadian data company linked to Cambridge Analytica had played a role in the organization\u2019s work. Groups campaigning against Brexit have written to Prime Minister Theresa May demanding an investigation into what members of her cabinet and her staff knew.  Andrew\u2019s take  Mr. Cook\u2019s points on privacy are absolutely right. But he has a tough needle to thread, given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is \u201csubject to each country\u2019s laws\u201d that it does business in. Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door \u2014 and I believe that \u2014 most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers: It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies. Apple says that it lobbied against the new law, but ultimately complied.

Gebr Knauf disclosed in a filing on Monday that it had offered to buy USG for $42 a share, or about $6 billion. That marked a 25 percent premium to USG closing price on Friday.  In rejecting the offer, USG said the proposal substantially undervalued the building products maker.  Knauf owns 10.5 percent of USG, making Knauf the second-largest shareholder in USG behind Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway with a 31 percent stake.  Berkshire had proposed an option for Knauf to buy Berkshire\u2019s stake in USG, according to the filing. The option would be exercisable only if Knauf bought all of USG\u2019s shares outstanding for at least $42. Berkshire proposed an option purchase price of $2 per share.  From Reuters:  The option provides a sweetener for Buffett to shed a profitable investment that originated in late 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, when Berkshire and Canada\u2019s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd bought $400 million of USG\u2019s debt. The $2 per share cost of the option would provide Berkshire about $86.8 million upfront, based on its 43.39 million share USG stake. Berkshire would keep that money even if Knauf proved unable to buy USG.  Shares of USG are up 19 percent Monday.

The trouble with writing the unvarnished truth in a memoir is that it requires you to be hard not only on others, but also on yourself.  Matt Young\u2019s inventive, unsparing, irreverent and consistently entertaining \u201cEat the Apple\u201d is that, but it is also a useful corrective to the current idealization of the American soldier \u2014 or in this case a Marine. Patriotism and respect for the military is so high in this country that we have lately held a national debate over whether professional athletes should be required to stand for the national anthem. Men and women in uniform are given preference in boarding airplanes, and are so routinely thanked for their service that the expression has become rote. Each new season brings a crop of movies and glossy TV serials dramatizing the heroics of our Special Operations.  Young sees hollowness and potential harm in this.  \u201cEnforcing the idea that every service member is a hero is dangerous,\u201d he writes. \u201cLike creating a generation of veterans who believe everything they did was good.\u201d Young warns of \u201ccreating an army of fanatics.\u201d  Service deserves respect, of course, but it does not in itself guarantee stirring and selfless acts of bravery. Young is his own case in point. He sees his experience \u2014 three tours in Iraq \u2014 as far from heroic. He is at least as disturbed by his duty as he is proud of it. These contradictory feelings are a central theme in his book. Years removed, he both loathes and pines for the man he became in the Marine Corps.

The chip maker only just wiggled out from under a takeover offer from rival Broadcom. What Qualcomm really needs is less a buyer and more a mediator.  There are usually two reasons to take a company private \u2014 the idea that the new owner can run it better, or a belief that the market is valuing it wrongly. Broadcom took the first path, and pointed at Qualcomm\u2019s paltry revenue growth and relatively low operating margins. Mr. Jacobs, whose father co-founded the company, is not the man to tackle those problems \u2014 if he were, he would have done it when he was executive chairman.  Valuation is a more compelling argument. It hinges on Qualcomm\u2019s rift with Apple. The iPhone maker is supposed to pay Qualcomm royalties on every phone sold, but has instructed its suppliers to hold back payment while it haggles with the chip maker on how those should be calculated.  A simple calculation shows how important this is: At $10 per phone on 250 million devices per year, Qualcomm would make $2.5 billion in revenue a year, almost all of which would flow to the bottom line. That\u2019s equivalent to a lump-sum value of perhaps $17 billion, assuming a tax rate of 21 percent and margins of 85 percent. If investors aren\u2019t pricing in any Apple royalty at all right now, that\u2019s enough to justify a price close to the $117 billion Broadcom offered.  Mr. Jacobs, however, is not the right person to mend the rift with Apple. One person who could, in theory, is SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son. The Japanese investor has a longstanding relationship with Apple \u2014 and counts both Apple and Qualcomm as investors in his Vision Fund, which is also one of the financial companies Mr. Jacobs reportedly has been asking to finance a bid. Conceivably, he could help them split the difference.  Would SoftBank\u2019s founder be up for the gig? Qualcomm, as a leader in 5G, is a trophy asset, and having Mr. Jacobs on board might neutralize some of the fear of foreign ownership that destroyed Broadcom\u2019s bid. But Qualcomm is also politically sensitive, a supplier to SoftBank already \u2014 and very big. Even with help, Qualcomm is probably too big a bite for SoftBank to chew. Mr. Jacobs, and Mr. Son for that matter, can use their daring to better effect elsewhere.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-16", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/business/dealbook/qualcomm-apple-mediator.html"}, {"article": "Apple may be dealing with the fallout for a while. The company published a lengthy memo in December saying that smartphone batteries became less effective over time and that its software was intended to prevent iPhones with older batteries from unexpected shutdowns. Apple also apologized to customers for the slowdowns, offered discounts for its battery-replacement program and said it would introduce software to gain visibility into the health of an iPhone battery.  Yet since then, consumer advocacy groups have filed lawsuits against the company for failing to disclose that the software would throttle old iPhones. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have also started an inquiry into the matter, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, who asked not to be named because the details were confidential. Bloomberg earlier reported the inquiry.  Early Wednesday, Apple said in a statement that it had received questions from some government agencies and that it was responding to them; the company did not specify the agencies it had heard from. The Justice Department declined to comment.  As for the wait times that Ms. Schipper and others are experiencing for a battery replacement, a spokeswoman referred to Apple\u2019s support webpage, which states that battery supplies at its stores may be limited.  Let\u2019s not wait around. Here\u2019s a guide to other solutions to keep an iPhone running in the absence of an Apple battery replacement.  Third-Party Repair Shops  Plenty of irate Apple customers are turning to local third-party repair shops to get their iPhone batteries replaced. At Mega Mobile Boston, twice as many customers are coming in for iPhone battery replacements than in years past, said Adam Fullerton, the store\u2019s operations manager.  Third-party repairs are a decent \u2014 but imperfect \u2014 solution. One drawback is that they vary in quality; some repair shops buy lower-quality batteries that don\u2019t last. So to find a good shop, rely on word of mouth and reviews on the web, similar to how you might seek out a good car mechanic.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Another issue is that if you service your phone with a third-party battery and later take your device in to Apple for repair, the company could refuse to service your phone. So if you go the third-party route, chances are you will have to stick with third-party repair shops through the end of your phone\u2019s life.

View all New York Times newsletters.  There\u2019s a less risky route here. On Apple\u2019s support webpage, you can look up third-party repair shops that are authorized by Apple as service providers. These are fixers who have been trained by Apple and carry original parts. But the list is short.  If you find a good local fixer, there are plenty of benefits to sticking with one long term. For one, third-party shops tend to have shorter waits. Mr. Fullerton said his shop could typically get an iPhone battery replacement done in about 30 minutes. The process involves opening the device, cleaning away the old waterproofing adhesive, replacing the battery and applying a new waterproofing adhesive.  For another, local repair shops make their prices competitive with the manufacturer\u2019s. In the case of batteries, many shops are discounting their battery replacements to match Apple\u2019s $29 pricing.  \u201cWe\u2019re probably losing money on it with the cost of a half-hour time from a technician,\u201d Mr. Fullerton said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like a loss leader in any other industry. If you\u2019re Best Buy and you get them to buy one item at cost, maybe you can teach them something about your business.\u201d  Finding a good repair shop can feel daunting, but if you ask around, your peers will probably have recommendations. For a sample, here\u2019s a list of highly recommended repair shops in the United States that I compiled from talking to repair experts I trust:  \u25a0 In Chicago: uBreakiFix Chicago  \u25a0 In San Francisco: MacRepair  \u25a0 In New York: Simple Mac  \u25a0 In Boston: Mega Mobile Boston  \u25a0 In Washington: Computer Geeks  \u25a0 In Austin, Tex.: Austin Mac Repair  Fix It Yourself  You can always replace an iPhone battery by yourself. The pros: You can choose the best components for repairs and minimize costs. The cons: Learning repairs can be time consuming, and if you mess up, you have no one to blame but yourself. And again, Apple stores could refuse to service your phone if it sees you have repaired it with third-party parts.  A good place to start for D.I.Y. repairs is iFixit, a company that provides instruction manuals and components for repairing devices. It is offering discounts on battery replacement kits for older iPhones, which cost $17 to $29. Each kit includes a new battery and the tools for disassembling iPhones.  Installing a phone battery can be intimidating. Replacing an iPhone 7 battery, for example, requires eight tools and 28 steps. Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, said some customers also opted to buy a battery from iFixit and then take it to a local repair shop for installation.

But since that could take weeks or months, don\u2019t suffer with a sapped phone battery in the meantime.  A better temporary solution is to invest in a battery pack that you can carry around until replacement batteries arrive at an Apple store. Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews products, has tested hundreds of battery packs to recommend a few. My favorite is the Anker PowerCore 20100, which can charge a smartphone every day for a week.  Ms. Schipper, the Seattle resident, is considering buying a battery pack.

Apple has some catching up to do. Mac laptops and iPads were once the dominant devices in American classrooms, but Google has shot past Apple with inexpensive laptops called Chromebooks. Google has also led the way in software products designed specifically for schools, with an app called Google Classroom that teachers use to take attendance, assign homework and do other tasks, among others.  Of the 12.4 million tablets and laptops shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States last year, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market, compared with a negligible share in 2012, according to IDC. In the same period, the share of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 22 percent from about half. And Microsoft Windows devices dropped to 18 percent from about 45 percent, IDC said.  School districts embraced Chromebooks because they were comparatively inexpensive and easy to use. Since the laptops were cloud-based, they could be shared among students who could pick up any device to get access to their documents. And school districts could use a software dashboard to manage thousands of devices at once. Districts that needed to institute online testing began buying Chromebooks in bulk.  Still, Apple generates the most revenue from school hardware sales in the United States, partly because its devices cost more. Of the $5.4 billion spent on school devices last year in the United States, Apple\u2019s iPads and laptops accounted for about $2.1 billion, followed by Chromebooks at $1.95 billion and Microsoft Windows devices at $1.35 billion, according to IDC.  Photo  Apple\u2019s new iPad signals how the company sees an opening at the lower end of the market. Last year, it lowered the price of its entry-level iPad to $329 for consumers and $299 for schools, helping to bolster sales of iPads after years of declines. Some Chromebooks and Windows laptops cost less than $200.

Broadcom typically slashes costs, especially research and development, and the company said it would do exactly that if it acquired Qualcomm. \u201cIn the long run that\u2019s not good for the country or for society,\u201d Mr. Dodson said.  He agreed with the Trump administration\u2019s assessment that, by cutting Qualcomm\u2019s research costs, Broadcom would be assisting Chinese rivals in the global race for dominance in 5G communications technology.  But as an investor, his reasoning can pretty much be reduced to one word: Apple.  Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm\u2019s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm\u2019s business model and Apple\u2019s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication.  Photo  If Qualcomm and Apple can just bury the hatchet, Mr. Dodson reasons, Qualcomm\u2019s revenues would soar, and its stock price would climb well past Broadcom\u2019s offering price of $79 a share. By Mr. Dodson\u2019s reckoning, once Apple resumes paying Qualcomm, the chip maker will be worth at least $84 a share, \u201cwhich is why Broadcom\u2019s offer didn\u2019t really engage my attention,\u201d he said.  That, however, is a big \u201cif,\u201d given the intractable positions both sides have staked out.  At the heart of the dispute is the way Qualcomm calculates the licensing fee it charges customers, which is a percentage of the cost of the net selling price of the entire handset \u2014 and not the price of the chip. That means that Apple, a high-cost producer whose iPhone X sells for as much as $1,000, has paid much higher licensing fees than low-cost competitors using exactly the same chip set.  Apple has called the arrangement an \u201cextortion scheme.\u201d It infuriates Apple that Qualcomm has, in effect, been subsidizing its low-cost competitors, including the very Chinese companies that Mr. Trump says he is so concerned about.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Qualcomm has countered that its intellectual property makes many of the iPhones\u2019 distinctive features possible, features that low-cost competitors haven\u2019t replicated, and therefore Qualcomm deserves a percentage of the cost of the entire device.  Mr. Dodson made little immediate headway when he met with a delegation of top Qualcomm officials late last month and pressed his case for a settlement with Apple. The officials, including the chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, and Paul Jacobs, a Qualcomm founder and, until recently, executive chairman, visited Mr. Dodson in San Francisco to make their case against the Broadcom bid.  In Mr. Dodson\u2019s account of the meeting, he urged the Qualcomm executives to settle with Apple rather than risk alienating it as a customer over the long term. But Qualcomm officials said that Apple was demanding more than they were prepared to give and that, on an engineering level, relations with Apple remained good. They assured him that eventually they would reach a settlement, revenues would normalize and Qualcomm stock would respond.

Still, \u201cI\u2019d like to see them budge\u201d on the licensing issue, Mr. Dodson said. \u201cI can see Apple\u2019s point.\u201d  But if Qualcomm stopped charging Apple a percentage of the device\u2019s cost, it would probably have to extend similar terms to all its major customers. It recently amended its agreement with Samsung without abandoning its approach to license fees. At the meeting, Qualcomm officials told Mr. Dodson they offered Apple similar terms, but Apple rejected them.  A Qualcomm spokeswoman declined to comment, as did an Apple spokeswoman.  Long-simmering tensions between Qualcomm and Apple reached a boiling point in 2016, when Qualcomm halted rebates it was giving Apple. Qualcomm claimed Apple had violated the terms of the rebate agreement by cooperating with South Korea\u2019s investigation into what Samsung and others said was exclusionary conduct by Qualcomm. Apple responded by withholding the license fees it paid manufacturers of iPhones, who in turn stopped passing on the payments to Qualcomm.  Photo  Lawsuits and counterclaims erupted, and Qualcomm reduced its revenue estimates by $500 million a year.  While Apple has continued to buy and deploy the latest Qualcomm chips, it also reached out to a rival chip maker, Intel, which began supplying an alternative to Qualcomm\u2019s chip for the iPhone 7. (That phone, the iPhone 8 and the X may contain either a Qualcomm or an Intel chip.)  Qualcomm claims that Apple has compromised the performance of Qualcomm-equipped handsets in order to mask their superiority over the Intel-equipped phones. (Both Intel and Apple have vehemently denied the claims.)  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Numerous lawsuits are now well underway in the United States, with some expected to go to trial later this year. Regulators in the European Union, Taiwan, South Korea and China have ruled that Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices are unlawful and have levied fines, decisions that Qualcomm is appealing. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is conducting its own investigation.  While armies of patent lawyers fight over the rival claims, investors have already rendered a verdict. Qualcomm shares, after peaking at more than $80 in 2014, dropped by nearly 50 percent, hitting a low of $44 in 2016.  Qualcomm\u2019s precipitous decline is what attracted Mr. Dodson\u2019s attention along with other so-called value investors, who look for stocks trading below their intrinsic value. He said his fund\u2019s average cost per share for its Qualcomm position was about $56, so the fund was still ahead even after the deal collapsed this week. On Thursday, Qualcomm was trading at around $60.  Still, Qualcomm\u2019s performance has knocked the Endeavor fund from its perch at the top of the Morningstar rankings. So far this year, it\u2019s 61st.  Now that Mr. Trump has rescued Qualcomm from the imminent threat of a Broadcom takeover, its financial prospects \u2014 and share price \u2014 will largely follow the twists and turns in the Apple standoff. While Mr. Dodson remains optimistic about the outcome, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s against all potential takeovers of Qualcomm.  Last week, there were rumors that Intel might launch a bid for Broadcom, which made Mr. Dodson wonder: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it bid for Qualcomm?

So who\u2019s left?  The same company that always seems to turn up when it\u2019s time to cross into a new era of technology: Apple.  I got to thinking about Apple\u2019s responsibility last week when two large investors wrote an open letter asking the company to do more about its products\u2019 effects on children. I was initially inclined to dismiss the letter as a publicity stunt; if you\u2019re worried about children and tech, why not go after Facebook?  But when I called several experts, I found they agreed with the investors. Sure, they said, Apple isn\u2019t responsible for the excesses of the digital ad business, but it does have a moral responsibility to \u2014 and a business interest in \u2014 the well-being of its customers.  And there\u2019s another, more important reason for Apple to take on tech addiction: because it would probably do an elegant job of addressing the problem.  \u201cI do think this is their time to step up,\u201d said Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google who now runs Time Well Spent, an organization working to improve technology\u2019s impact on society.  \u201cIn fact,\u201d Mr. Harris added, \u201cthey may be our only hope.\u201d  For one thing, Apple\u2019s business model does not depend on tech addiction. The company makes most of its money by selling premium devices at high profit margins. Yes, it needs to make sure you find your phone useful enough to buy the next one, but after you purchase your phone and sign up for some of its premium services, Apple doesn\u2019t really need you to overdo it. Indeed, because it can\u2019t make infinite battery life, Apple would probably be O.K. if you cooled it with your phone a little.

Every tech company needs a presence on the iPhone or iPad; this means that Apple can set the rules for everyone. With a single update to its operating system and its app store, Apple could curb some of the worst excesses in how apps monitor and notify you to keep you hooked (as it has done, for instance, by allowing ad blockers in its mobile devices). And because other smartphone makers tend to copy Apple\u2019s best inventions, whatever it did to curb our dependence on our phones would be widely emulated.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Harris suggested several ideas for Apple to make a less-addictive smartphone. For starters, Apple could give people a lot more feedback about how they\u2019re using their devices.  Imagine if, once a week, your phone gave you a report on how you spent your time, similar to how your activity tracker tells you how sedentary you were last week. It could also needle you: \u201cFarhad, you spent half your week scrolling through Twitter. Do you really feel proud of that?\u201d It could offer to help: \u201cIf I notice you spending too much time on Snapchat next week, would you like me to remind you?\u201d  Another idea is to let you impose more fine-grained controls over notifications. Today, when you let an app send you mobile alerts, it\u2019s usually an all-or-nothing proposition \u2014 you say yes to letting it buzz you, and suddenly it\u2019s buzzing you all the time.  Mr. Harris suggested that Apple could require apps to assign a kind of priority level to their notifications. \u201cLet\u2019s say you had three notification levels \u2014 heavy users, regular users and lite, or Zen,\u201d Mr. Harris said.  Apple could set rules for what kind of notifications were allowed in each bucket \u2014 for instance, the medium bucket might allow notifications generated by other people (like a direct message in Instagram) but not those from the app itself (Instagram just sending you an alert to remind you that your high school friend\u2019s mom\u2019s brother posted a new picture recently).  \u201cAnd then Apple could say, by default, everyone is in the middle level \u2014 and instantly it could save a ton of users a ton of energy in dealing with this,\u201d Mr. Harris said.  There\u2019s a danger that some of these anti-addiction efforts could get too intrusive. But that\u2019s also why Apple would shine here; building a less-addictive phone is chiefly a problem of interface design, which is basically Apple\u2019s entire corporate raison d\u2019\u00eatre.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Another thing that Apple is good at is marketing, and I suspect it could make a lot of gauzy ads showing people getting more out of iPhones and iPads by unplugging from them for a little while. Note that it already sells a device, the Apple Watch, whose marketing extols the magic of leaving your phone behind.  Done right, a full-fledged campaign pushing the benefits of a more deliberative approach to tech wouldn\u2019t come off as self-interest, but in keeping with Apple\u2019s best vision of itself \u2014 as a company that looks out for the interests of humanity in an otherwise cold and sometimes inhumane industry.  \u201cHow we live with technology is the cultural issue of the next half-century,\u201d said James Steyer, the founder and chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit group that studies how children are affected by media.  He suggested that the feeling was ripe for Apple to tap into. \u201cIt\u2019s something that everyone cares about \u2014 whether you\u2019re a Republican or a Democrat, liberal or conservative, whether you live in San Francisco or Biloxi, Miss., you know that you and your kids are part of the arms race for attention,\u201d he said.  Apple released a statement last week saying it cared deeply \u201cabout how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them,\u201d adding that it had a few features on addiction in the works.  Apple hardly ever talks about future products, so it declined to elaborate on any of its ideas when I called.

Citigroup shares climbed 2% before the opening bell following the bank\u2019s latest earnings report. Citigroup said that it lost $18.3 billion in the fourth quarter, its earnings wiped out by a $22 billion charge related to the new tax law, though revenue rose from a year earlier. Without the tax charge, the bank would have topped profit expectations.  Shares of General Electric shed 3.6% premarket. The industrial conglomerate said it expects a $6.2 billion after-tax charge in its fourth quarter after reviewing GE Capital\u2019s runoff insurance portfolio. CEO John Flannery also said the firm will examine separately traded units for its major businesses.  UnitedHealth shares rose 2.2% premarket after the health insurer\u2019s quarterly profit beat analysts\u2019 expectations and the firm raised its yearly outlook, as revenue from both its health care and health care services businesses increased.  Shares of Apple added 0.7% premarket following the news that the iPhone maker and Chinese tech giant Tencent have settled their tiff over tips, allowing users of Tencent\u2019s popular WeChat messaging app to resume giving monetary gifts to their favorite video-streaming stars and content creators.  Alphabet, the parent company of search-engine giant Google, rose 0.7% before the opening bell. Google said it is expanding its sprawling network of undersea cables to plug into new regions around the world, in a bid to speed up its cloud-computing business and catch up to rivals Microsoft and Amazon.com.  Amazon shares were up 1.1% premarket. Data was released showing products carrying the Whole Foods brand helped push sales at Amazon\u2019s online grocery-delivery service, AmazonFresh, up 35% to $135 million in the last four months of 2017 over the previous four months.  Shares of Ford Motor climbed 0.5% premarket after an executive said the auto maker will now spend $11 billion on electrified vehicles through 2022, increasing its previous estimates as it races to catch up on battery-powered cars.  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. shares advanced 0.8% premarket. CEO Sergio Marchionne said he has no plans to sell its Jeep business or split up the company, cooling speculation but leaving the company\u2019s long-term strategy unclear. Late Friday, the firm issued a recall for more than 162,000 late model Chrysler Pacifica minivans to fix a software flaw that could stall out vehicles while being driven.  Shares of another auto maker, General Motors, also rose and were up 3.4%. The company said it will take a $7 billion non-cash charge following recent tax changes and said excluding the charge, it expects 2017 profits to come in at the high end of its guidance.  Shares of Spectrum Brands Holdings climbed 1.2% before the opening bell. Energizer Holdings Inc. said it will buy the firm\u2019s battery and portable lighting business for $2 billion in cash. Spectrum\u2019s battery portfolio includes Varta and Rayovac brands and generated $866 million in revenue last year. Energizer shares rose 12%.  Merck & Co Inc. shares surged 5.1% premarket after the drug company announced positive late-stage trial results for a lung cancer treatment.  Shares of Blackhawk Network Holdings added 24% premarket to $45.10 following the news that Silver Lake and P2 Capital Partners have agreed to acquire the financial technology firm for approximately $3.5 billion, including debt. The deal values Blackhawk at $45.25 a share, a roughly 24% premium over Friday\u2019s closing price.  Viacom shares declined 3% premarket.

Apple shares fell 1.2% premarket following a Wall Street Journal report that the iPhone maker is slashing planned production of the iPhone X for the three-month period ending March 31, in a sign of weaker-than-expected demand for the pricey handset.  Shares of MetLife tumbled 7.4% before the opening bell after the nation\u2019s second-largest life insurer by assets disclosed for the first time the scale of a records mistake that left possibly tens of thousands of workers without their monthly pension benefits. The company said it expects to increase its reserves by $525 million to $575 million on a pretax basis to account for the problem.  Amazon.com, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase said the firms are partnering on a new company to figure out how to reduce health-care costs for their hundreds of thousands of U.S. employees. Amazon was up 0.4% premarket, while Berkshire was down 0.2% and JPMorgan was up less than 0.1%.  Aetna shares fell 2.6% premarket following the insurer\u2019s quarterly sales and profit beats, though revenue dropped 5.6% in the most recent quarter from a year earlier. Other insurers were also down following the announcement from Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan. UnitedHealth Group, Anthem and Cigna all dropped at least 5%.  Shares of Wal-Mart were down 1.4% before the opening bell following a Journal report that the retail giant plans to ask suppliers to deliver more goods to warehouses exactly on time or face fines, another step in its efforts to keep inventory low and shelves stocked as it battles with Amazon.  McDonald's shares declined 0.3% premarket. The fast-food giant posted quarterly sales and profits that beat analyst expectations.  Shares of Maxim Integrated Products shed 11% premarket after Japanese firm Renesas Electronics denied a CNBC report saying that Renesas was in talks to acquire Maxim.  Callidus Software shares added 11% to $36.25 premarket on the news that German software company SAP SE has agreed to buy the firm for $2.4 billion to bolster its cloud-computing business. SAP will play $36 a share for the California-based firm.  Shares of Thomson Reuters climbed 11% before the opening bell following a Reuters report saying private-equity firm Blackstone Group is in advanced talks to buy a 55% stake in its financial and risk business for more than $17 billion. Blackstone was down 1.1%.  Pfizer shares were down 1.9% premarket. The drug company posted quarterly earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street expectations and gave an upbeat guidance for 2018, though sales projections for the year fell below some analyst targets.  Shares of United Continental Holdings climbed 1.1% to $66.50 premarket following a JPMorgan Chase analyst upgrade to overweight from underweight and price target increase to $83 from $60.  Harley-Davidson shares shed 6.4% before the opening bell. The motorcycle manufacturer reported its fourth straight year of declining sales and said it expects shipments to decline again this year.

Longbow Research analyst Shawn Harrison lowered his rating on the technology giant to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d on Wednesday, reflecting the view among some Wall Street researchers that the latest group of iPhones will deliver modest sales performance. He didn\u2019t specify a price target.  \u201cWe now forecast only a good, not great iPhone cycle,\u201d Mr. Harrison wrote in a research note.  He said the more expensive price point of the X model may hinder some demand and the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus models have received a \u201clukewarm\u201d reception, both of which could restrain growth in iPhone shipments. He estimates that iPhone production growth will be in the high-single digits, lower than the consensus view of 10% that he cites.  \u201cAlthough there are now expanded drivers to AAPL\u2019s business, the iPhone continues to wag the dog,\u201d Mr. Harrison wrote. \u201cGiven our change in estimated iPhone growth profile near term, we anticipate this dynamic will limit upside stock appreciation.\u201d  Wall Street analysts have historically been hesitant to bet against Apple Inc., whose shares are up 47% over the last 12 months and 670% in the past decade. Twenty-nine of 37 analysts tracked by FactSet have \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201coverweight\u201d ratings on the stock, with an average price target of $192.73. There are no \u201csell\u201d or \u201cunderweight\u201d ratings.  The average analyst price target has increased each month for the past 14, according to FactSet data. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts, for example, lifted their price target on the stock to $200 from $180 on Wednesday.  Shares were down 0.2% to $175.88 in recent trading Wednesday.  Many analysts have cited factors that could drive the stock higher, such as a tax-code overhaul, which is likely to encourage companies to bring home cash held overseas and could be handed to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Apple has also seen higher demand for other products such as its Mac and iPad recently.  Longbow\u2019s downgrade appears to be the second among analysts in the last month. Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal lowered his rating on the stock to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d in December and dropped his price target to $175 from $185. He suggested that Apple\u2019s stock has historically dropped after new iPhone models come out, and this cycle appears to be no different.

Apple Inc., AAPL 0.34% Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% \u2014with a combined market value of more than $2 trillion\u2014all boosted growth by broadening their reach into new areas.  Apple\u2019s revenue rose 13% to $88.29 billion, fueled by its move to increase smartphone prices behind its new flagship iPhone X, released in November at $1,000. The company, whose profits topped $20 billion for the first time, is also increasingly benefiting from its services business, including App Store sales and music and payments services.  Google parent Alphabet has averaged revenue growth of at least 20% over the past 32 quarters, when adjusting for currency movements, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney. Google is building in other areas, including cloud computing, a business that Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said brings in $1 billion a quarter.  Meanwhile, Amazon\u2014long known for prioritizing growth over earnings\u2014delivered a profit exceeding $1 billion for the first time as its revenue jumped 38% to $60.5 billion.  More than the other two companies, Amazon has spread beyond its core market. The online-retail giant has built the largest cloud-computing business, created a major Hollywood studio and, more recently, become a big bricks-and-mortar retailer with the acquisition of Whole Foods, which accounted for roughly 7% of its sales.  Two of the other largest tech companies by market value\u2014 Microsoft Corp. and Facebook Inc. \u2014reported record sales a day earlier. Revenue at Microsoft rose 12% to $28.92 billion as its cloud-computing division continued to grow, while Facebook\u2019s revenue jumped 47% to $12.97 billion.  Those companies are the five most valuable in the U.S. by market capitalization, the first time a single industry has occupied that position in several decades, according to S&P Capital Inc.  As the tech giants expand their clout across a widening band of commerce, they have increasingly drawn scrutiny from lawmakers and consumers over a range of issues, from their dominance of certain markets, to how they use their vast troves of consumer data, to the impact their products have on society.  The extraordinary runup in their share prices has helped fuel popular awareness of the companies\u2019 power, says Youssef Squali, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.  \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of the fact that these have become such huge behemoths that they bear responsibility to society, and on the other hand you have all this lack of control of personal data,\u201d Mr. Squali said.  Facebook is contending with claims that its massive social network has had harmful effects on mental health and is used to disseminate hate speech, violent live videos and fabricated news articles. Lawmakers have scrutinized Facebook and other social-media firms, saying they failed to take more steps to keep Russian-backed actors from sowing division during the U.S. presidential election.  Facebook says it is addressing the issues in a number of ways, including employing more people who handle safety and security issues and ranking publisher posts based on user evaluations of trustworthiness.  Apple is facing criticism from prominent investors over the way smartphones affect children, as well as federal probes over its disclosure that it issued software updates that slowed performance on iPhones with older batteries. Apple apologized and said it would never do anything to harm its customers.  Google drew a $2.71 billion fine from European regulators, who said the search giant favored its comparison-shopping service over rivals. Google\u2019s YouTube, meanwhile, is grappling with a backlash from marketers over the placement of their ads in front of undesirable videos, including YouTube\u2019s curated lineup of \u201cpreferred\u201d content.  Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on a call with analysts that new controls to review top videos on YouTube and set new limits on which content can run ads will make the site a safe place for advertisers. There have been concerns, he said, but \u201cwe\u2019re working really hard to address them and respond strongly.\u201d  A major shift for the tech industry came with the election of President Donald Trump, who had been critical of the industry in part due to what he said was a lack of U.S. job creation and investments overseas. Tech CEOs a little over a year ago met with the then-president elect. Shortly thereafter, plans for a tech council to advise the president dissolved.  Most recently, Mr. Trump called out Amazon, tweeting that the U.S. Postal Service should charge the online retail giant and other companies more to deliver packages.  The mood extends to Capitol Hill. Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) are working on legislation that would make political advertising with companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google more transparent. Meanwhile, U.S. Senators Jerry Moran (R., Kan.) and Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) this week wrote the Federal Trade Commission to ask it to investigate companies that sell fake social-media accounts, mentioning Twitter and YouTube specifically.  At the annual World Economic Forum last month, the world\u2019s largest technology companies defended themselves against complaints about everything from perceived anticompetitive behavior to threats from artificial intelligence. Some critics questioned the companies\u2019 potential elimination of jobs through advanced technology, while others pointed to their control of large amounts of personal data.  Salesforce.com Inc. CEO Marc Benioff, at the Davos, Switzerland, forum, called some tech companies\u2019 behavior \u201cnefarious,\u201d comparing the companies to the cigarette industry and calling for more government regulation. Martin Sorrell, CEO of advertising giant WPP PLC, compared the firms to Standard Oil, a U.S. oil giant that was broken up after regulators determined it was a monopoly.  In response to a question about Amazon\u2019s size, the company\u2019s retail chief, Jeff Wilke, said in an interview late last year with The Wall Street Journal that its businesses are very diverse and horizontally large. \u201cWe have incredible competition,\u201d he added.  Trip Miller, founder and managing partner at Gullane Capital LLC, which owns shares in Amazon, Apple and Alphabet, said management at the companies was strong, and they appear to have good opportunities for continued growth.  \u201cWhile we do understand some of the concerns around data and them potentially having so much information on our lives, I think it\u2019s just a byproduct of the world we live in,\u201d he said.  Apple\u2019s results offered hope that it can sustain its solid performance even amid stagnating global demand for smartphones. Analysts and investors have worried the company is too dependent on the iPhone, which accounts for about two-thirds of its revenue, as customers hold onto their phones longer and therefore buy fewer new ones.  Sales of the iPhone X in the quarter lifted the average selling price for iPhones by nearly 15%, Apple said. The 1.3 billion iPhones and other Apple devices now in active use helped its services business report an 18% jump in revenue. Results also were buoyed by strong growth in the division that includes its smartwatch and AirPods wireless earbuds.  Alphabet\u2019s profit jumped 28% to $6.84 billion, excluding a giant $9.9 billion charge related to the new U.S. tax law which turned its bottom line into the red. While the ad business makes up nearly all of its profit, Alphabet is investing in a dozen businesses such as self-driving cars and cybersecurity in hopes they will drive future revenue.  Amazon\u2019s core retail business was the main producer of its revenue growth in the quarter, as holiday shoppers went online. It also benefited from the company\u2019s $13.5 billion acquisition of Whole Foods, which generated more than $4 billion in revenue.  Amazon is known for reinvesting heavily in its business, and has said in recent quarters it is in an investment phase focusing on international expansion and building out its video content, among other initiatives.  Contributing its profitability in the fourth quarter was a tax benefit of $789 million, part of the tax overhaul. Still, Amazon\u2019s cloud-computing division put in a strong performance, as did its growing advertising business. And the company also worked on efficiency at its warehouses.

AAPL 0.34% said it will acquire Next Issue Media LLC and its digital-magazine-subscription service Texture, a product developed by top magazine companies that bundles together some 200 subscriptions into one monthly service.  The acquisition comes as Apple looks to beef up its services business, which includes music streaming and mobile payments.  Apple has set a goal of increasing total revenue from services to more than $40 billion by 2020. The company generated nearly $30 billion in services revenue in its fiscal year ended in September.  Apple typically takes a 15% cut of subscription services from publishers and content providers, including Netflix Inc. and HBO, if those subscriptions are purchased through the App Store.  Terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed. Next Issue Media and Texture are owned by Cond\u00e9 Nast, Meredith Corp. , Hearst Corp., Rogers Communications Inc. and KKR & Co.  The magazine industry for years has sought ways to transition from print to online, but has faced profound challenges competing with tech giants for digital ad dollars, while print ad revenue continues to decline.  Last year, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc. accounted for more than 63% of U.S. digital ad spending, according to eMarketer, while the magazine world has been buffeted by steady cutbacks and numerous rounds of consolidation.  Next Issue, which launched in 2009, was envisioned as a way for publishers to compete against tech titans like Apple, whose app store has come to dominate distribution in the digital publishing marketplace.  In a joint statement, Texture\u2019s key publishing investors said the sale was in line with the shifting marketplace the industry has faced.  \u201cThis new relationship with Apple not only will deliver new audiences and further the reach of our collective brands, but reflects the way consumers are engaging with media today as they look to discover content and subscribe with more convenience and ease,\u201d they said.  Texture, which offers a monthly, $10 subscription to magazines such as Vanity Fair, Good Housekeeping, Time, Sports Illustrated, and National Geographic, fits into Apple\u2019s effort to bring news and information to iPhone and iPad users. The company launched Apple News in 2015 and has been aggregating and providing news stories to iPhone users since then.  \u201cWe are committed to quality journalism from trusted sources and allowing magazines to keep producing beautifully designed and engaging stories for users,\u201d said Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president who oversees the services business.

Or at least that\u2019s been the case recently. The largest U.S.-listed company by market capitalization has risen for five straight sessions, including a 3.4% jump on Thursday after regulatory filings showed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway raised its stake in the iPhone maker last quarter.  That took Apple\u2019s price to $172.99, up nearly 12% from its recent low and pulling it out of correction territory.  The S&P 500 is similarly up for five straight sessions, marking its largest five-day percentage gain since December of 2011, according to The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Market Data Group. The index is up 5.8% from its 2018 closing low from Feb. 8, as our Morning MoneyBeat newsletter noted on Friday.  Apple and its tech-giant peers are still a leading force in the stock market, even after driving gains for most of the nearly nine-year-old bull market and especially the last year. For those trying to discern where stocks head next in an uncertain market, Apple\u2019s stock is as good a place to look as any.  Apple dropped more than 13% during the worst of the recent selloff. The company had a particularly bad session in early February, dropping 4.3% the day after an earnings report that showed the company sold fewer iPhones and projected weaker-than-expected revenue for the current quarter. Both Apple and the S&P 500 pointed slightly lower in premarket trade Friday.  The selloff proved to be short-lived. Wall Street analysts, bullish group that they are, still expect Apple\u2019s stock to keep gaining. Among the 39 whose price targets are tracked by FactSet, analysts project on average gain of 11% over the next year to a price of $192.06. The recent selloff only caused them to lower targets slightly from $193.03 at the end of last month.  Apple hasn\u2019t been pushing the market higher on its own, of course. Ten of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 were in the green on Thursday. But the technology sector was the S&P 500\u2032s second-best performing on Thursday. What\u2019s more, it has had the second-best performance so far this year, up 5.7%.  A key driver of the sector is Apple, whose $878 billion market cap gives it a 3.5% weighting in the S&P 500, according to FactSet.

An iPhone X is seen on a large video screen in the new Apple Visitor Center in Cupertino, Calif., in November. Photo: elijah nouvelage/Reuters  Apple Inc. AAPL 0.34% is being investigated by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission over potential securities violations related to the company\u2019s disclosure of a software update that slowed older iPhones, people familiar with the matter said.  The two probes add pressure on the tech giant to address criticism from customers and lawmakers after it acknowledged in December that it was throttling the performance of older iPhones as batteries aged. The company later apologized for the issue and slashed the price of an iPhone battery replacement to $29 from $79, hoping to win back customer goodwill.  Apple acknowledged in a statement that it is responding to questions from some government agencies, though it declined to disclose which agencies or any details regarding the questions. It also reiterated what it said in December, noting that it has \u201cnever\u2014and would never\u2014do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades.\u201d  The news of the investigations was reported earlier by Bloomberg.  Regulators and prosecutors often open investigations that don\u2019t result in any charges being filed, and securities investigations often take more than a year. It isn\u2019t clear why federal officials are focusing on potential securities violations involving an issue affecting customers.  Generally in such a case, the SEC could try to fault a public company for failing to make timely disclosures about material information that would affect the stock price. The company\u2019s potential liability would probably turn on whether the fallout from poor battery performance was likely to be material and whether the company delayed disclosing it or had the proper systems to detect and account for it.  Apple\u2019s stock has fallen about 4% since Apple\u2019s acknowledgment, but much of the losses have occurred in the past week ahead of Thursday\u2019s planned quarterly earnings report. Some of the declines have come amid reports of possible weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone X. On Tuesday, Apple\u2019s shares fell 0.6% to $166.97.  Still, some analysts have said the battery issues could hit Apple\u2019s financials. Barclays said in a note this month that Apple could sell 16 million fewer iPhones this year, and lose $10.29 billion in revenue, directly related to customers choosing to replace batteries rather than replace their iPhones.  Apple last week announced it will release a spring software update with a feature that shows an iPhone battery\u2019s health and recommends when it needs to be serviced. Customers also will be able to see if the power-throttling feature is being used on their device and switch it off.  During an interview with ABC News earlier this month, Chief Executive Tim Cook said last year\u2019s update was designed to prevent users from having their phone power off during a call or while taking a photograph. He said Apple made the change to improve customers\u2019 experience and that Apple disclosed the feature at the time, though, he said people may not have been paying attention.  \u201cMaybe we should have been clearer, as well,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cWe deeply apologize to anybody that thinks we had some other kind of motivation because our motivation is always the user.\u201d  Since acknowledging it throttled iPhone performance, the company has faced questions from consumer and watchdog groups in France, Italy and China. In France, the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office said early this month it opened an investigation into Apple for potential deception and \u201cprogrammed obsolescence.\u201d The investigation could lead to preliminary charges or be dropped.  Earlier this month, U.S. Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, sent Mr. Cook a letter seeking more information on how the company tracked customer complaints of processing performance and whether or not it considered offering rebates to customers who had replaced their batteries at a higher price.  Apple hasn\u2019t commented on the French investigation or Mr. Thune\u2019s letter.  Battery life and processing speeds are two of the most important features on smartphones. To prevent iPhone 6, 6s and SE devices from powering off automatically\u2014something that drew complaints last year from Chinese consumer-protection groups\u2014Apple said it updated its operating system, iOS, to slow certain tasks that required more computing power than a device could provide. It expanded the practice to the iPhone 7 in the fall.  The Apple investigations add to a mounting list of clashes between the Trump administration and tech firms over the past year, including a rollback of internet regulations that Silicon Valley had championed during the Obama era. Tech firms also have run into political trouble lately in Congress, particularly over alleged Russian online meddling in the 2016 election, but also user privacy concerns and liability for online sex trafficking.  \u2014John McKinnon contributed to this article.

Apple\u2019s dominance in classrooms has faded in the face of cheaper laptop options. Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images  Apple Inc. said it is updating its entry-level iPad with capabilities designed to appeal to students and new software for teachers, as the company tries to recharge sales of the tablet and shore up its dwindling share of the U.S. education market.  The company Tuesday said its new 9.7-inch iPad includes a faster processor and works with the Apple Pencil stylus, which previously worked only with higher-end iPad Pro models.  The entry-level iPad\u2019s price remains at $329, the lowest-priced tablet available from the company. Schools, which receive discounts on pricing, can buy the device for $299.  The announcement, held at Lane Tech College Prep High School in Chicago, was coupled with software and support capabilities aimed at schools. They included more free cloud storage, a management system to assist schools with creating Apple IDs for students and a cloud-based app called Schoolwork that allows teachers to monitor students\u2019 progress on assignments.  The kindergarten-through-12 market represents a critical opportunity for tech companies to get young people accustomed to their operating systems. Introducing students to those systems could help sway future purchasing decisions that span the rest of their lives, said Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University.  \u201cThe moment you get someone on your ecosystem, and they become fluent in your operating system, the switching costs become very real,\u201d Mr. Galloway said. A lot of consumers start on Apple\u2019s or Google\u2019s operating system and never switch, \u201cso it\u2019s logical to lock them in early,\u201d he said.  Technology companies have been pushing computers and other devices into the classroom since at least the 1970s, and Apple took an early lead with its easy-to-use operating system.  But the company\u2019s dominance faded in the face of cheaper laptop options such as Google Chromebooks from Alphabet Inc. or Windows-powered devices from Microsoft Corp. While many of those devices cost less than $300, Apple\u2019s MacBook starts at $999.  Apple\u2019s lowest-priced iPad, which got a $70 price cut last year, offers the company its best chance to compete in the cost-conscious education market.  But the addition of a Pencil and a keyboard\u2014which are necessary to take many computer-administered tests and could add more than $150 to the price\u2014make the iPad a costlier option than rival low-priced laptops, said Ben Davis, a senior education analyst with Futuresource Consulting.  Despite efforts by Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook to champion iPads as laptop replacements, iPad sales have fallen 40% from their peak in fiscal 2013 to $19.22 billion.  Losing ground to Chromebooks and Windows devices in the classroom contributed to the iPad\u2019s struggles, said Frank Catalano, an independent education technology analyst with Intrinsic Strategy.  The update to the entry level iPad is unlikely to reverse Apple\u2019s slump in education sales, analysts say. Over the past five years, Apple\u2019s share of computing shipments in the $18 billion U.S. education hardware market has fallen to 19% from 50%, according to Futuresource Consulting. Alphabet now has a 59% share, compared with Microsoft\u2019s 22%.  In addition to competing on price, Alphabet and Microsoft devices have gained ground in classrooms by offering a strong mobile-device management system that helps IT departments block students from exiting a browser during a test, Mr. Davis said.  Apple on Tuesday announced a system to enable students to share iPads, so they can log into any tablet and reach their own documents and apps. It said Apple\u2019s school management system would allow schools to create as many as 1,500 Apple IDs in minutes. The company also said it was expanding free iCloud storage for schools to 200 gigabytes from 5 GB.  The new Schoolwork app is coupled with a developer platform called ClassKit that developers can use to create apps that teachers can assign to students. It also announced a new curriculum called \u201cEveryone Can Create\u201d that allows teachers to integrate drawing, music, filmmaking and photography into lessons.  \u201cEducation is such a big part of who we are as a company and has been for 40 years,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cTechnology can help teachers deliver a unique and personalized learning experience to all kids. We\u2019ve never stopped believing that.\u201d  While the iPad remains popular with children and teachers, educators have expressed frustration that they must seek out curriculum apps, rather than getting a simple suite of apps as Google provides, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with market-research firm Creative Strategies.  \u201cThey have done a lot on manageability, which will make a big difference\u201d for many schools, Ms. Milanesi said. \u201cWhile price has not changed for iPad, you get a lot more with it.\u201d  Write to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-updates-ipad-with-stylus-support-1522167400"}, {"article": "If Apple Inc.\u2019s AAPL 0.34% iPhone X is a problem, so far it\u2019s a high-quality one.  Apple launched the expensive device later than usual during its fiscal first quarter that ended Dec. 30. The phone came on the 10th anniversary of the company\u2019s first smartphone, and was heralded by Apple and its fans as the \u201cfuture of smartphones.\u201d But an opening price of $1,000 is rich for any smartphone, and production issues appeared to keep supply of the phone relatively tight at least in the first few weeks after its early November launch.  That appeared to weigh down sales. Apple said Thursday that it sold a total of 77.3 million iPhones during the quarter, which was below the 80 million units analysts had been expecting. That made for a 1% year-over-year decline in iPhone unit sales for the quarter, though iPhone revenue popped by 13% to hit $61.6 billion. That is a signal that the iPhone X appealed to enough of the company\u2019s fan base to boost iPhone\u2019s average selling price to about $796\u2014the highest on record and a strong 15% jump from the same period last year.  That still isn\u2019t the \u201csupercycle\u201d that many investors have been expecting. And Apple\u2019s outlook for the fiscal second quarter ending in March suggests more of the same. The company projected total revenue in the range of $60 billion to $62 billion for the quarter, which would make for a year-over-year gain of 15%. Despite reports that Apple is cutting iPhone production this quarter due to weaker sales, Wall Street still had been expecting overall revenue to rise 24% in the quarter.  Apple\u2019s share price had slipped about 6% over the past two weeks, so the disappointing projection was somewhat priced in. And the company is still immensely profitable, with operating income jumping 12% year over year to a record $26.3 billion.  Any concerns about cyclical iPhone sales were somewhat soothed by Apple\u2019s service-arm revenue, which had another period of double-digit growth during the quarter. Services comprised nearly 13% of Apple\u2019s trailing 12-month revenue compared with 9% two years ago.

AAPL 0.34% will start selling its voice-activated speaker HomePod in stores Feb. 9, after a launch delay that cost the company sales during the critical holiday shopping season.  The tech giant, in announcing the sales date Tuesday, didn\u2019t explain why the product missed a promised December ship date. The HomePod can be preordered online beginning Friday.  Market leaders Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% continued to sell Echo and Google Home devices during the holidays, while Apple worked on a rival product it said wasn\u2019t ready for sale.  Amazon was the first major tech company to enter the smart-speaker market in late 2014, opening a wide lead by selling more than 20 million Echos even before tallying sales for the recent Christmas season. Its hockey puck-sized Echo Dot is estimated to account for more than half of Amazon\u2019s speaker unit sales, largely because of its lower price, which dropped to $30 during the holidays before rising to $50.  The smart-speaker shipments world-wide are expected to rise more than 50% this year to 56 million units, according to the market researcher Canalys. The U.S. will account for more than half of those sales, it said.  At $349, the HomePod costs considerably more than Amazon\u2019s latest Echo and a Google Home, whose list prices are $100 and $129, respectively.  Apple has tried to differentiate its speaker by emphasizing sound quality, particularly when playing music, over the device\u2019s ability to perform tasks.  Voice-activated speakers have moved to the forefront in a battle over what some technology analysts see as the future of computing. Virtual assistants such as Apple\u2019s Siri, Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Cortana and Google Assistant are expected to be embedded in more than 4 billion consumer devices by the end of 2018, allowing people to perform simple computing tasks by voice such as searching for information or turning off lights, according to the research firm IHS Markit.  From the Archives In a 2.5-hour keynote, Apple announced a slew of new hardware and software products. WSJ's Joanna Stern recaps what you need to know about the most important announcements (Originally published Sept. 8, 2017) .  Apple\u2019s Siri has a much wider presence by virtue of being featured on more than a billion iPhones and iPads. However, Amazon and Google are aiming to catch up by cutting deals to put their assistants into such products as Toyota Motor Corp. vehicles and Sony Corp. televisions. They also offer greater functionality; Amazon\u2019s Alexa, for example, can perform thousands of commands compared with hundreds by Siri.  The HomePod was the latest in a series of Apple products that faced delayed. The AirPods earbuds missed their promised ship date last year, and the Apple Watch, promised in early 2015, arrived late in April of that year.  Apple said the HomePod initially will be available in the U.S., U.K. and Australia, and will arrive in France and Germany this spring.

Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images  The launch of Apple Inc.\u2019s AAPL 0.34% new iPad in a Chicago high school is both an effort to better serve students and one to fend off Google, which has caught up and passed the once-dominant player in the education market.  Apple CEO Tim Cook gathered media in Chicago to lay out its newest efforts geared toward the education market. They include a new suite of software services along with an updated iPad. The new tablet adds the company\u2019s latest mobile processor with some other upgrades for the same price as its predecessor. That includes a 9% price discount for schools.  Apple last updated its iPad lineup a year ago, culling some offerings while trimming the price on its flagship 9.7-inch version. That didn\u2019t arrest a long-running decline in sales for the pioneering tablet. iPad unit sales fell 4% in the fiscal year ended September, and Wall Street expects another 6% decline for the current year. But Tuesday\u2019s announcement wasn\u2019t simply Apple trying to bolster what is now its fourth-largest business, behind the iPhone, services and Mac in terms of annual revenue. The company has lost significant ground to arch-rival Google in the education market. Apple accounted for nearly half of the laptops and tablets sold in the U.S. K-12 market in 2013, while Google\u2019s Chromebooks accounted for 20%, up from 1% a year earlier, according to Futuresource Consulting. Last year, devices running Google\u2019s Chrome OS accounted for 58% of that market.

Watch the full documentary at wsj.com/docs. (Originally Published June 28, 2017) Altering that trajectory will be a major challenge, even for the world\u2019s most valuable company. Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., GOOGL -0.12% has the advantage of both price and ubiquity. The cheapest Chromebooks are about 40% less than the cheapest iPad, and Google\u2019s G-Suite of services is already widespread in schools. Gmail alone passed the 1-billion-user mark two years ago. Apple\u2019s software often gets high marks. But the company\u2019s software and services only work on its own equipment. That means the company\u2019s prospects are always closely tied to its ability to sell devices. And since those devices still drive the majority of Apple\u2019s operating profits, the company can\u2019t really afford to compete on price. Google, which doesn\u2019t even make most of the Chromebooks bearing its operating system, has no such limitations. Apple\u2019s approach has served it well overall. But in budget-constrained markets like education, the right price isn\u2019t always one the company can meet.

AAPL 0.34% is scheduled to report results for its fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 30, after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what you need to know.  EARNINGS FORECAST: Earnings of $3.86 a share is the consensus of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, compared with $3.36 a share a year ago. The company hasn\u2019t provided earnings guidance for the quarter but in November said it expects gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5% in the quarter.  REVENUE FORECAST: Revenue of $87.06 billion is expected by analysts, compared with $78.4 billion reported a year earlier. In November, Apple said it expected revenue to be between $84 billion and $87 billion in the quarter.  Dollars & Cents: Apple raised prices last year in a move that has the potential to boost overall revenue even as the number of iPhones it sells stagnates. Analysts believe the strategy paid off in December. Apple is projected to report a 1.5% increase in iPhone shipments, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet, but the $1,000 iPhone X, released on Nov. 3, is expected to lift the average selling price of the device 9% to $755. Those higher prices are expected to lift iPhone revenue 10% to $60 billion in the period. Meanwhile, Apple kept more old iPhone models on the market in December, a move that market research firm Strategy Analytics predicts helped the company increase iPhone shipments 22% in China.  Taxman: Apple in mid-January announced it would pay $38 billion in taxes on the $252 billion it holds overseas, but it hasn\u2019t said how much of that money it will bring back to the U.S. or outlined what will be returned to shareholders through buybacks or dividends. The company typically announces capital return plans in April or May and may hold off discussing it until then. But expect analysts to ask for more clarity on Apple\u2019s plans now that it no longer needs to hold cash overseas to avoid paying higher U.S. taxes. Also, look for the company to update its new effective tax rate. Morgan Stanley expects Apple to benefit from a lower tax rate of approximately 15.9% due to tax reform, adding $1.13 to its current fiscal-year earnings per share  Promised Land: Analysts and investors will zero in on Apple\u2019s revenue projections for the March quarter. With the iPhone X contributing less than two months of sales during the last quarter, many analysts had banked on strong sales in the current period because of pent up demand. Some have scuttled those projections recently amid reports that iPhone manufacturing has slowed. Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein reduced his projections for the current quarter to 53 million units from 66 million and warned the earnings call could trigger downward earnings estimates for the period. Analysts currently project revenue for the March quarter of $66.54 billion, according to FactSet.  The Great Divide: Apple doesn\u2019t break out its mix of iPhone sales by model, forcing analysts and investors to come up with their own estimates. One of the key indicators of demand is channel inventory. Apple tries to keep inventory in the five- to seven-week range. UBS analyst Steve Milunovich said that if the iPhone X is a disappointment relative to Apple\u2019s expectations, then the company\u2019s inventory levels could be higher. During its last earnings call for the quarter ended Sept. 30, the company indicated it expected healthy demand for the iPhone X by saying it increased inventory by 1.3 million smartphone units to support the iPhone 8 launch, 50% less than the 2.5 million it added during the release of the iPhone 7 in the same period a year earlier.  Trouble No More: The company\u2019s business in China is showing signs of improvement. Sales rose in the September quarter from a year earlier, marking the first quarterly gain in more than a year. Analysts expect this quarter to deliver another increase with sales projected to rise 9.2% to $17.73 billion, according to FactSet. The growth is expected to be driven by improved iPhone sales in that market and the continued strength of App Store sales.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-01", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-expected-to-report-higher-prices-drove-record-quarterly-revenue-1517482800"}, {"article": "The Chicago landlord of what Apple Inc. calls its \u201cmost ambitious store\u201d has put the building on the block in a sales process that will test the power of the popular brand name in a tempestuous retail climate.  Real-estate private equity firm Walton Street Capital has hired Eastdil Secured to market the Norman Foster-designed Apple Store that opened last fall and has become a popular new attraction along the reinvigorated Chicago River waterfront.  Walton last year paid $370 million for the Apple Store, which at the time was under development, along with 401 N. Michigan Ave., the 35-story office and retail building next door.  Now the firm is hoping to sell the 20,000-square-foot Apple Store along with 10,000-square-feet of retail space in the office building for as much as $175 million, according to people familiar with the offering.  Walton would retain the office space. Real-estate investors often buy mixed-use properties and then split off the valuable retail space and sell it separately.  Eastdil and potential buyers of the Apple Store were having preliminary discussions last week at the global Mipim real estate conference in Cannes, France, according to people at the conference. Eric Mogentale, managing principal of Walton, declined comment.  The sale comes at a time when retail real-estate in general is under enormous pressure because of competition from online shopping and the contraction and failure of many big name retailers. Values of many malls and shopping centers have been falling.  Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO, attended the store opening. Photo: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News  But Apple Stores have long been the gold standard in the retail world because of the high traffic they attract. Not only do they ring up strong sales, but they also boost traffic and sales at neighboring stores.  A report by Green Street Advisors in 2016 found that average sales for 220 malls with Apple Stores came to $710 per square foot, compared with $630 per square foot for malls without Apple Stores. The study was based on a database that covered about 1,400 properties.  Apple is well aware of the power of its brand and uses it to negotiate low rents. The rent it is paying for the new Apple Store in Chicago is well below the average $400 to $500 per square foot being paid nearby along Michigan Avenue, in an upscale retail area known as the Magnificent Mile, said people familiar with the matter.  Apple began discussing the new Chicago store more than two years ago with Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who has made development of the Chicago River waterfront a big priority. More than $60 million was spent on the standalone store, which has a 32-foot-tall glass fa\u00e7ade and a thin carbon roof.  The project included the redevelopment of the surrounding plaza area so that now Michigan Avenue is linked to the riverfront by granite staircases on either side of the store. The plaza, once cut off from the water, now \u201cflows effortlessly down to the river,\u201d Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s chief design officer, said when the store opened.  The store opened in October in a ceremony attended by Mr. Emanuel and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook.  Apple officials describe the store as the company\u2019s most ambitious partly because of its design and its connection to the river. The store is also bringing in well-known professionals to teach Apple device users about the products, an experience that isn\u2019t available at most other Apple stores around the world.

WSJ's Joanna Stern has tips on how to defuse the situation. Photo: Natalia Osipova/The Wall Street Journal.  Every night, I compose the following letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook :  Dear Mr. Cook,  Your iCloud storage is full.  Yours,  Joanna Stern  I never send it because I\u2019m not as unsympathetic as Apple, which by my count blasts out millions of annoying out-of-iCloud-storage alerts a day. Hey look! You got one just now.  I call them iCloud ransom notes. Don\u2019t pay Apple for storage and the threats will persist and all your data will be unsafe. Pay and the messages will end. Plus, you\u2019ll get some\u2026 iCloud. Whatever that is.  Apple is pretty matter-of-fact about it: \u201cWe notify our customers when they need more storage to continue to keep their information safely backed up in iCloud,\u201d a spokesman says.  If you have an iPhone, you\u2019ve probably seen one of these. Apple sends notifications to millions of customers when they need more storage space so their information remains safely backed up in iCloud. These messages can be avoided. Photo: APPLE  Yet after the holiday iPhone buying season, I began to realize that many of even the most tech-savvy people in my life don\u2019t quite understand how iCloud works. Heck, I had to go to an Apple Store\u2019s iCloud class to get some clarity. And my dad didn\u2019t know he had \u201cthe iCloud\u201d until he remembered the $1 monthly charge.  So I decided to tackle the messy, many-tendriled storage system. What do we need to understand? What does Apple need to start doing better? The following guide helps those who pay for iCloud get their money\u2019s worth\u2014and those who refuse to pay for iCloud live a happier, notification-free life.  What is iCloud?  Lose your iPhone but have iCloud? You won\u2019t lose much at all. That\u2019s the simplest way to understand this thing.  If your photos, videos, contacts and more are backed up to iCloud, they\u2019re safe and accessible from any other Apple device\u2014and most web browsers\u2014by just logging in. For a quick overview of what you actually have stored, log into icloud.com with your Apple ID and poke around.  Here\u2019s the big catch, though: Apple offers only 5 gigabytes of free iCloud storage space. That\u2019s like offering a Siberian tiger a Tic Tac for dinner. With the amount of photos and videos we take today, it\u2019s not enough. For a company with about $270 billion in the bank, I\u2019d expect it to at least match Google\u2019s 15GB of free cloud storage\u2014or beat it. Do I hear 20GB?  If you do need more, Apple charges you: $1 a month for 50GB, $3 for 200GB, $10 for 2 terabytes.  Before we dive into the rest, take out your iPhone. Go to Settings, then tap your name up top, then tap iCloud. You should be looking at a handy bar graph of your own iCloud storage allotment.  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  Chances are your bar graph is going to be dominated by two big chunks:  Backups. When your device is on Wi-Fi, locked and charging, iCloud automatically backs up all the data\u2014messages, settings, your homescreen layout, app data and more.  Photos. The Photos app has a clever trick: It uploads shots as soon as you take them. This iCloud Photo Library setting is on by default; if you turn it off, photos and videos are included in backups.  If that bar graph is getting filled up, you\u2019re probably starting to get those nagging out-of-storage notifications, which brings us to Mr. Frost\u2019s two diverging roads.  Road 1: Fine, I\u2019ll Pay  OK, so you agree to pay Apple every month.  First, you\u2019ve got to decide on a plan, and the new iCloud storage family sharing is incentive to pay for the 200GB or 2TB plans. Since last fall\u2019s iOS 11 release, you can share those buckets of storage with up to five members of your family. Don\u2019t worry, Johnny, if you upload a photo of your new vape, Mom won\u2019t be able to see it.  Whichever plan you choose should cover your phone backups and all-important photo storage. But you still need to fine-tune the way photos are handled.  On your iPhone, go to Settings, then scroll down and tap Photos. If you are worried about running out of space on your iPhone itself, select \u201cOptimize iPhone Storage.\u201d  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  This ensures that full-resolution photos and videos are stored in iCloud. You\u2019ll still see preview images on the phone, but it sometimes takes a few seconds before you can view the sharp original pic.  How do you tell what is actually backed up? You should see the update status on the bottom of the first Photos tab.  Once your backups are on track and your photos are squared away, you may find you have leftover space. This is where iCloud Drive comes into play. You can dump random files into it through the iCloud web interface, or\u2014on a Mac with the latest OS\u2014sync your Desktop and Documents files.  On iPads and iPhones, there\u2019s a new Files app, which is, confusingly, another door to iCloud Drive. Plus, you can add files in iOS through supported Apple apps such as Pages, Keynote and Notes, or through the sharing function: Tap the share button, then \u201cSave to Files.\u201d  While you can use iCloud Drive to sync files across your multiple devices, it still lacks some of the basics you get with Google Drive or Dropbox. For instance, on iCloud.com you can\u2019t upload a folder of files from your desktop.  Road 2: Nope, Not Paying  OK, you\u2019ve bought a phone for $700 or more and decided not even $1 more for Apple. Understandable.  So how do you survive with just 5GB and make the ransom notes cease? First, try to clear room. Delete backups of your old devices by going to iCloud > Manage Storage > Backup.  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  Apple doesn\u2019t offer a way to see the thousands of compressed files in these old backups. There are third party apps, such as AnyTrans, that do.  You can also thin out your current backup: Tap on the backup labeled \u201cThis iPhone\u201d then turn off third-party apps. There\u2019s no real need to back up apps like Twitter and Facebook ; just back up games that save your progress.  If that isn't enough, turn off iCloud backup altogether (iCloud > iCloud Backup). You can still manually back up your iPhone by syncing to iTunes\u2014even via Wi-Fi.  Backing up photos, of course, remains a necessity. For that, I recommend Google Photos, since it offers unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos. Photos with resolution over 16 megapixels will be downsized, but you can use Google\u2019s included 15GB of storage to keep those higher-resolution shots.  I find the transition process to be cleanest on a computer. Pull all the photos you have from your phone\u2014plus any photos that may live in your iCloud storage\u2014into the Photos app on your Mac, then go to File > Export. On Windows, use the iCloud for Windows app.  Go to Google Photos, then either drag all your photos to it, or use the uploader tool. Back on your iPhone or iPad, in the iCloud settings, turn off iCloud Photo Library and download the Google Photos app.  I leave you here with a moral challenge: Every time a storage-full message makes you mad, take to social media and urge Apple to give us 20GB free. Or just pay Apple the damn dollar.

Apple on Wednesday said an update to its operating system for iPhones and iPads this spring will include a new \u201cHealth Records\u201d feature that will import and store medical information covering allergies, conditions, immunizations, lab results, medications, procedures and vitals.  A dozen hospitals are participating, including Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles and Penn Medicine in Philadelphia.  The effort to securely simplify and democratize health records won\u2019t be easy, say physicians who watched Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google wrestle with similar efforts over the years.  Apple\u2019s late arrival to medical records, though, gives it advantages its rivals didn\u2019t enjoy, physicians say, including the benefits of more consolidated hospital networks and concentration among medical-record systems.  \u201cApple is in the right spot,\u201d said Eric Topol, author of \u201cThe Creative Destruction of Medicine\u201d and a physician at the nonprofit Scripps Research Institute. \u201cThere\u2019s a long ways to go still,\u201d he said.  Starting in 2011, the U.S. government spent an estimated $40 billion in stimulus money on health-care information technology, according to McKinsey, encouraging doctors and hospitals to install electronic-medical-records systems and triggering a massive shift toward electronic health information.  Apple said it has secured participation from two of the U.S.\u2019s largest medical-records providers, Epic Systems Corp. and Cerner Corp., which account for more than 50% of medical-records management, as well as Athenahealth Inc., ATHN -1.51% which accounts for almost 2%, according to KLAS Research, which analyzes the industry.  But Apple needs to get more hospitals to share data in order for the Health Records feature to be valuable, said Noga Leviner, co-founder of PicnicHealth, a startup that helps patients consolidate their medical records.  Some hospitals in the same system use different variations of electronic medical records\u2014even from the same provider\u2014and oftentimes don\u2019t have agreements to share data, Ms. Leviner said. People want complete medical-records information\u2014not just records from only one of their six doctors, she said.  \u201cThe government spent $40 billion on this and they failed\u201d to bring those hospitals together, Ms. Leviner said.  Another challenge: expanding information beyond simple listings such as allergies and recent lab results, she said. Tens of millions of Americans with chronic conditions need far more detailed information, such as pathology reports for cancer patients or medical images for people with knee injuries.  Apple\u2019s push into medical records is its latest effort to break into the $3.2 trillion U.S. health-care market. Last year, the company announced its first medical study of heart rhythms using the Apple Watch and it launched HealthKit in 2014, providing a way for different health apps to share information.  HealthKit helped Apple earn the trust of physicians and hospitals since it includes standards that comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, said Richard Milani, a physician at Ochsner Health System in New Orleans who focuses on tech in health care, and works with Apple.  Dr. Milani said HealthKit helped create a secure system that can be used to transfer medical records to the Health Records feature. Apple said Health Records will encrypt patients\u2019 information to protect their privacy.  Apple also is adopting the leading standard for transferring electronic records known as the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, or FHIR, making it easier for hospitals and medical-records vendors to share information with the iPhone maker, he said.  Apple said it won\u2019t receive any health-record data. Instead, users will be able to add a health provider on their phone and import their records directly from the provider to the device. The company said the system is the same it uses for corporate email, allowing information to go from a corporate server directly to the phone without Apple ever seeing it.  Users will be able to back up their health records to iCloud, and that information will be encrypted with only users having the key to the data on their device.  Apple said it has no plans to monetize Health Records and designed the feature to create a better health experience for users.  Dr. Milani said the company has told hospitals the same thing. \u201cThe only way to monetize this is to say, \u2018We offer something a competitor doesn\u2019t offer to sell more devices,\u2019\u201d he said.  If it works, Health Records could ease a burden on patients, Dr. Milani said. He envisions a future where an iPhone user from Louisiana might be on vacation in Michigan and in need of medical treatment. Rather than the hospital having to look up that patient\u2019s records, the patient can pull them up on a phone.  \u201cThis is a consumer-empowerment move,\u201d Dr. Milani said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have all the information about you and you\u2019ll control it, and that\u2019s exactly who should control it.\u201d  Write to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-24", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-dives-into-complex-field-your-medical-records-1516832897"}, {"article": "Q.

Another potential issue is whether or not two of Hulu\u2019s owners \u2014 Disney, which owns ABC, and Comcast, which owns NBC Universal \u2014 will be able to play nicely with each other after they become owners with uneven stakes in the platform.  \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly awkward,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, a global financial services firm. \u201cThe question is which way it goes: Does Comcast buy out Disney? Or does Disney buy out Comcast?\u201d  The corporate uncertainties have come to Hulu at a time of mounting losses: It lost $920 million in 2017, according to BTIG, which projects that the business will lose $1.67 billion this year. Hulu is also facing more intense competition than ever as its rivals disrupt the entertainment industry by handing out big checks. In recent months, Netflix has signed the producers Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy to nine-figure deals; Amazon has pledged more than $200 million toward a \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d series; and Apple, a newcomer in the field, is shelling out hundreds of millions to create original programming of its own.  The outlook is not all bleak. According to Peter Rice, the president of 21st Century Fox, Hulu had more subscriber growth domestically than Netflix in the last two quarters of 2017. And this month, Disney signaled its commitment when its chief strategy officer, Kevin Mayer, suggested that the other streaming services now in the works at Disney would not get in Hulu\u2019s way.  \u201cWe\u2019re very much in support of growing Hulu,\u201d Mr. Mayer said at Recode\u2019s Code Media conference. \u201cIt takes an investment, for sure.

The quarter was the 10th in a row of more than 90 percent revenue growth for its flagship Azure cloud computing service, which directly competes with Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services.  Amazon customers hoping to avoid being locked into one service could be helping growth, said Kim Forrest, an equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group. \u201cIf you\u2019re really smart you\u2019ll have not one provider but two,\u201d she said.  Since Chief Executive Satya Nadella took the helm in 2014, Microsoft\u2019s cloud business - which includes products such as Office 365, Dynamic 365 and Azure - has emerged as a major growth area.  Revenue from what Microsoft calls its intelligent cloud segment rose 15.3 percent to $7.8 billion in the company\u2019s fiscal second quarter, including 98 percent growth for Azure. Analysts on average had expected $7.51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The nine justices will hear arguments on Tuesday in a case that pits the interests of tech companies and privacy advocates in safeguarding customer data against the demands of law enforcement in obtaining information crucial to criminal and counterterrorism investigations.  The case began with a 2013 warrant obtained by prosecutors for emails of a suspect in a drug trafficking investigation that were stored in Microsoft computer servers in Dublin. The company challenged whether a domestic warrant covered data stored abroad. The Justice Department said because Microsoft is based in the United States, prosecutors were entitled to the data.  The case is being closely watched by other countries wrestling with similar concerns, including members of the European Union. A ruling is due by the end of June.  A 2016 decision by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals siding with Microsoft marked a victory for tech firms that increasingly offer cloud computing services in which data is stored remotely. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court.  Globally dominant American tech companies have expressed concern that customers will go elsewhere if they think the U.S. government\u2019s reach extends to data centers all around the world without changes being made to the law.  Microsoft, which has 100 data centers in 40 countries, was the first American company to challenge a domestic search warrant seeking data held outside the United States.  Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, told reporters last week the U.S. government should not be able to act unilaterally to access such data without taking into account the laws and interests of other countries.  \u201cIt\u2019s more likely to be a recipe for international tension and chaos,\u201d Smith said.  Solicitor General Noel Francisco, the administration\u2019s top lawyer in Supreme Court cases, said in court papers that a ruling for Microsoft \u201cwould hamper domestic law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts.\u201d  If the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of Microsoft, the government could still gain access data held overseas, but the process would be more cumbersome and potentially take longer.  Lawmakers are considering making changes to the 1986 law.  Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in Congress to update the statute, a move backed by both Microsoft and the administration. The measure would let U.S. judges issue warrants while giving companies an avenue to object if the request conflicts with foreign law. If Congress were to pass the bill before the Supreme Court rules, the case would likely become moot.  BEYOND REACH  Though Microsoft is based in the United States - Redmond, Washington, to be precise - the appeals court said the emails were beyond the reach of domestic search warrants obtained under a 1986 U.S. law called the Stored Communications Act.  The Microsoft customer whose emails were sought told the company he was based in Ireland when he signed up for his account.  Other companies including IBM Corp, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google filed court papers backing Microsoft. Google has mounted challenges similar to Microsoft\u2019s.  The administration has the support of 35 states led by Vermont who say they routinely seek access to data stored overseas, especially in cases involving child pornography.  Several foreign governments, including Ireland and Britain, filed court papers raising concerns about the U.S. government\u2019s position.  Ireland\u2019s government said in its brief that the question of how law enforcement authorities can access such information is already covered by a 2001 treaty with the United States that allows for information sharing and enforcement of court orders.  The treaty\u2019s procedures \u201crepresent the most appropriate means to address requests such as those which are the object of the warrant in question,\u201d Ireland\u2019s brief said.  The European Commission, representing the 28-country European Union, filed a brief saying that when a country is seeking data from outside its jurisdiction \u201cthe interests and laws of that foreign jurisdiction must be taken into account.\u201d  The Supreme Court has ruled twice in recent years in major cases concerning how criminal law applies to new technology, both times ruling against law enforcement. In 2012, the court held that a warrant is required to place a GPS tracking device on a vehicle. In 2014, the court ruled that police need a warrant to search a cellphone seized during an arrest.  In the court\u2019s current term, which ends in June, the justices are due to rule on another privacy issue on whether police need search warrants to access cellphone location information held by wireless carriers. Based on the Nov. 29 oral argument, the justices appear likely to rule against law enforcement again.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-26", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://in.reuters.com/article/usa-court-microsoft/rpt-u-s-supreme-court-weighs-microsoft-overseas-data-fight-idINL2N1QD2B7"}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped on Wednesday and the Dow closed above 26,000 for the first time as investors\u2019 expectations for higher earnings lifted stocks across sectors.

Nearly 50 percent were found to be supported at least in part following an investigation, she said, and more than half of those resulted in the termination of an employee who engaged in unacceptable behaviour.

The Pentagon said it\u2019s making the shift to the cloud to strengthen its use of emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, machine learning and the internet of things.  Having already won two other government cloud contacts, Amazon Web Services is widely perceived as the front-runner for the Defense Department award. Industry groups had called for multiple contract awards, which could improve the opportunities for companies including Oracle, Microsoft, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and International Business Machines Corp.  Chanda Brooks, a Pentagon contracting officer, told the gathering Wednesday that market research shows that multiple companies are capable of meeting the requirements and that the \u201cfull and open competition\u201d would result in a single award. Van Name, of the \u200eDefense Digital Service, which recruits technology experts from the private sector for stints working on projects at the Pentagon, denied that the department is leaning toward Amazon.  \u201cIt\u2019s about the best proposal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no favorites.\u201d  The industry pushed back on the department\u2019s sole-source position.  Roger Waldron, president of the Coalition for Government Procurement, which represents defense contractors including Oracle, IBM and Microsoft, said \u201cgoing to a single vendor closes the market to just that vendor for a decade.\u201d  Microsoft and IBM also separately criticized the department\u2019s decision. Microsoft said it was \u201cdisappointed,\u201d while Sam Gordy, general manager of IBM U.S. Federal, called the move \u201cflawed.\u201d Google declined to comment, and Oracle didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.  Scope of Initiative  Underscoring the scope of the initiative, Essye Miller, the Defense Department\u2019s acting chief information officer, said the Pentagon\u2019s information technology covers \u201cover 1,700 data centers and approximately 500 different cloud initiatives across the department.\u201d  Seattle-based Amazon leads the cloud infrastructure market with 44.2 percent, followed by Microsoft\u2019s Azure with 7.1 percent, China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. with 3 percent and Google Cloud Platform at 2.3 percent, based on total cloud industry 2016 revenue, according to research firm Gartner Inc.  Amazon already has a cloud contract with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency dating back to 2013 that\u2019s valued at $600 million. The online retail giant led by Jeff Bezos has the fastest-growing lobbying arm among tech companies and has spoken to the Pentagon about cloud or procurement since at least 2016, according to federal lobbying disclosures.  Oracle\u2019s Stake  Oracle has a particular interest in how the contract is awarded because it has long-term contracts with multiple government agencies that use its flagship database to store information on their own systems. As the agencies look to switch to cloud computing and eye market leader Amazon, these moves threaten Oracle\u2019s traditional revenue sources. Oracle has tried to protect its database business by offering cloud services of its own, but has come late to that market.  Technology companies worried that the Pentagon favors Amazon point to the decision in early February to award a contract of as much as $950 million to REAN Cloud LLC, an Amazon partner, to help migrate its data to the cloud. On Monday, the Pentagon said it was unaware of the award, made by its Silicon Valley-based innovation unit, and reduced the contract to $65 million.  In a statement Wednesday, Sekhar Puli, REAN Cloud\u2019s managing partner, said that \u201cbased on the threat of legal action and protest by the old guard, the only winners in this delay are those large companies that stand to lose money if the DoD proceeds with innovation. In the meantime, the cost of maintaining antiquated government infrastructure has not subsided.\u201d  Oracle formally protested the REAN contract in February, saying the company was opening a door for Amazon Web Services and asserting that Amazon pressures clients to use REAN, according to a person familiar with the filing.  Respective Strengths  The companies competing for the Defense Department contract are expected to put their respective strengths on display as they present bids. While Amazon is the leader in cloud services, Mountain View, California-based Google emphasizes its focus on security and Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft touts its ability to move existing databases onto the cloud in stages, while keeping some tasks and data in-house if the customer wants.  The transition to the cloud could threaten on-site database providers such as Redwood City, California-based Oracle and IBM, based in Armonk, New York, that have long supplied government technology products but were later entrants into the cloud market.  \u201cFor Oracle and IBM, any government contract feels important. They\u2019re entrenched government vendors,\" said Lydia Leong, a cloud analyst at Gartner. \u201cShifts to the cloud and going off of their architecture is not a happy situation for them.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Bergen, Dina Bass, Naomi Nix, and Nico Grant", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-07", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-07/amazon-oracle-microsoft-jockey-for-pentagon-s-cloud-business"}, {"article": "At Microsoft Corp.'s Dutch research facility at the Delft University of Technology, several large cylindrical metal tubes hang from the ceiling.  Each tube - a dilution refrigerator used to cool circuits down to temperatures colder than deep space - costs more than $500,000, and has helped Microsoft's researchers create an elusive subatomic particle that the company hopes will serve as the building block of its effort to create commercially-viable quantum computers.  The scientists say they have clear evidence of the creation of Majorana fermions \u2013 an elementary particle that its own anti-particle \u2013in a tiny wire that is composed of both semiconducting and superconducting materials, according to research published in the journal Nature Wednesday.  A clean room where nanowire circuits are manufactured at Microsoft's research facility. Photographer: Jeremy Kahn/Bloomberg  The unique properties of these fermions means that they could be used to create quantum computers with much lower error rates than the designs being trialed by rival companies, such as International Business Machines Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, that are also racing to bring quantum computers to market. Currently, those other designs produce too many errors in their calculations to be useful for practical applications, such as the ability to create new chemical catalysts or break the most popular forms of encryption.  Microsoft will now attempt to braid these tiny fermions to create qubits \u2013 the fundamental calculating hardware used in quantum computers. Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive officer, has said that quantum computing is one of three breakthrough technologies \u2013 the others are artificial intelligence and augmented reality \u2013 that will be critical to the future of the company. Microsoft hopes to eventually rent time on quantum computers to businesses through its cloud computing network.  So far, Microsoft\u2019s efforts have trailed some of its competitors. D-Wave Systems Inc. in 2011 became the first company to sell a quantum computer, although its technology can only perform a certain subset of mathematical problems. Google and IBM have machines that are thought to be close to achieving \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d \u2013 the ability to tackle a problem too complex to solve on any standard supercomputer.  Microsoft, in contrast, hasn\u2019t yet managed to create a working qubit.  The company has devoted significant resources to prove that it can use Majorana fermions to build a less error-prone \u2013 and thus potentially more useful \u2013 machine. The existence of particles that would also contain their own anti-particle was postulated by Italian theoretical physicist Ettore Majorana in 1937. But researchers only observed evidence suggesting the unique fermions actually existed in 2012. But, as the Microsoft researchers write in Nature, data from these earlier experiments \u201cwere noisy,\u201d leading skeptics to speculate that they could be caused by other phenomena. In the new paper, the Microsoft scientists offer much clearer data that, the company says, should silence any remaining doubters.  The U.S. tech company has assembled a globe-spanning team of scientists for its quantum effort, working at labs in the U.S., the Netherlands, Denmark and Australia. It has also put one of its most experienced executives, Todd Holmdahl, who previously delivered both the Xbox game console and the HoloLens augmented reality goggles, in charge of the project. Holmdahl said in an interview with Bloomberg in November that Microsoft would have a quantum computer on the market within five years.  At Delft, Leo Kouwenhoven, a physicist who now works as the principal researcher for the company, gave a tour of the lab, which is also shared by academics working on several different approaches to building a quantum computer \u2013 including a rival team that is funded by Intel Corp. Microsoft soon plans to move into an entire wing of a different building as it scales up its quantum computing project.  Next to a few of the fridges are giant metal doughnuts \u2013 150-pound magnets that the Microsoft team is using to try to create the braiding, essential for their qubits to be less-error prone. The magnets, Kouwenhoven admits, are a double-edged sword, as their size and weight also make the experiments more difficult to run. He said Microsoft believes the calculations of its quantum computer \u2013 assuming it actually manages to create one \u2013 will be between 1,000 and 10,000 times more accurate than what existing machines have been able to achieve.  Kouwenhoven said it is his group\u2019s goal to have produced a working qubit using Majorana fermions by the end of this year. On the floor above where the refrigerators are installed, young graduate students sit at computers analyzing colorful graphic displays that show what is happening inside the circuitry deep within the refrigerator. Kouwenhoven stops to ask if one if he has been able to see indications of Majorana fermions braiding as they have ramped up the power of their magnets. \u201cNo,\u201d the student shakes his head. Kouwenhoven shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to get accurate measurements at higher magnetic energies,\u201d he says. \u201cSo far we haven\u2019t seen evidence of this transition to topological phase.\u201d Theory, Kouwenhoven knows, is on his side.

In his typical hyper-excited, semi-shouting style, Ballmer capped his presentation with, \"Windows! Windows! Windows!\"  That was then. Windows hasn't been the heart and soul of Microsoft for several years, and Microsoft made it extra official last week. In a corporate reorganization, Windows was effectively downgraded in the Microsoft corporate hierarchy. The person now in charge of Windows occupies a lower rung of the organization than his predecessor did and reports to the senior executive in charge of Microsoft's current top priorities: corporate software, cloud computing and artificial intelligence.  It was a bureaucratic shift but one charged with symbolism. Windows is no longer the sun in Microsoft's solar system around which all other planets spin. Windows is an outlying moon -- an important one, but still just a moon. \"The future of Windows is bright,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in an email to employees on Thursday. It seemed like an afterthought.  Windows! Windows! Windows! Microsoft's Windows revenue has remained relatively steady in the last decade, but the software accounts for a shrinking share of total company revenue Source: Gadfly calculations from Microsoft financial disclosures.  Microsoft's corporate reshuffle reflects the company's financial reality. In 2010, the Windows systems for personal computers were the biggest source of revenue for the company, making up about 28 percent of total sales. In Microsoft's most recent fiscal year, Windows was only the third-biggest source of revenue, behind the Office software bundle and a group of technologies for businesses including computer server software, databases and Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing service. Windows' share of total company revenue was just 16 percent after adjusting for Windows sales that the company spreads out over multiple years.  By design, Nadella -- who's been the boss for four years -- has broken sharply from his predecessors, Bill Gates and Ballmer. And nothing signaled that dividing line between Microsoft's past and future more than Nadella's choice to de-emphasize Windows.  The changing focus was clear from his first months on the job. In a 2014 memo to employees that was Nadella's first mission statement as CEO, he peppered 10 mentions of the Windows operating system for PCs into a roughly 3,000 word missive, and not until the 21st paragraph. He used the word \"cloud\" 21 times.  Heart and Soul Windows was the third-biggest source of revenue for Microsoft last year Source: Microsoft  Nadella's first significant product unveiling as CEO was a version of Microsoft Office tailored to iPads. The software had been developed when Ballmer was still in charge, but it sat on a shelf as the company debated whether the Office app for iPads would hurt Windows sales. Fear of harming the Windows franchise won out until Nadella arrived.  Under Nadella, Microsoft has also made Windows less of a software Big Bang. The entire company used to be organized around developing and releasing a significant new edition of Windows every three years or so. Now, Windows is just another piece of software or app that gets updated continually, like Netflix or Apple's iPhone operating system.  There's less a new version of Windows than many slightly new ones that come out regularly. Microsoft also made those regular updates part of the cost of buying a new computer or signing a contract for a fleet of business PCs rather than paying for a new machine or upgrading the operating system when a new version comes out. It's remarkable how smoothly Microsoft managed a fundamental change to how Windows is developed and released to the public.  Even if Microsoft had kept stressing Windows, the technology world was moving away from it. Personal computer sales have been declining since 2012. Adding up smartphone, tablet and PC sales, Windows software powers less than 15 percent of all the computing devices sold in the world each year. And Windows is nonexistent in emerging areas of technology including driverless cars and internet connected devices for the home.  Microsoft's answer has been to stress areas of technology where it is relevant and has opportunities to lead in the future. That goes back to cloud computing, artificial intelligence and corporate software. All the data amassed by autonomous cars has to be saved somewhere, and it requires hefty computing power to analyze it all. Microsoft wants to be in the middle of all that. The company just won't be there with Windows, Windows, Windows.

Apple still collects our data \u2014 and reserves the right to share it \u2014 but the company has a much better track record than newer tech titans.  \"The truth is, we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer \u2014 if our customer was our product,\" Cook said on Wednesday. \"We've elected not to do that.\" Asked what he'd do if he were in Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's shoes, he replied, \"I wouldn't be in this situation.\"  In reality, Apple collects more information about its customers than Facebook because it offers more products and services. It knows everything from an iPhone's location to its owner's taste in movies and music. It's all in the company's privacy statement, including the frank admission that Apple will share the data with \"strategic partners that work with Apple to provide products and services, or that help Apple market to customers\" and with law enforcement. Apple also lets applications that run on its platform (including Facebook) hoover up data. And it does have a small ad platform that allows targeted advertising.  Apple's closest equivalent in terms of data collection, sharing and \"pass-through\" to app developers is Google, which offers roughly the same array of services (plus search) and also owns mobile and desktop operating systems. The difference is that Apple has imposed some voluntary restrictions on itself: For example, it anonymizes location data (unless you're using the \"Find My iPhone\" feature) and generally employs \"differential privacy\" \u2014 a cryptography-based practice of obtaining usage and preference data without linking it to specific users. Google and Microsoft also use that to some degree, and a co-inventor of differential privacy, Cynthia Dwork, has even worked for Microsoft Research, but Apple was the first to market the technique as an advantage for its customers.  Cook clearly thinks of these self-restrictions as a good way of staving off external regulation. On Wednesday, he scolded Facebook for not being as far-sighted. \"I think the best regulation is no regulation, is self-regulation,\" he said. \"However, I think we're beyond that here.\"  As a user, however, I wouldn't put much trust in any company's ability to regulate itself. Cook has been wary of monetizing Apple's user base, but he won't be CEO forever. And people do change their mind, especially when it comes to picking up money that's there for the taking. Regulation \u2014 such as the EU's General Data Protection regulation, launching in May \u2014 is a more reliable way to ensure a level playing field. That's why Google, Apple and Microsoft all have good, convenient privacy controls which allow the user to turn off various kinds of data collection, erase data that companies already have and opt out of targeted advertising. Facebook, too, promises to put such controls in place soon.  But even external regulation isn't a reliable guarantee of privacy. Most people won't fiddle with the controls because they may not even realize what all the fuss is about. And by default, companies with advertising-based business models will want to collect as much information as they can and anonymize as little of it as they can. Neither Google nor Facebook, for example, will make the same commitment as Microsoft that no ads will be targeted based on your email and chat contents. Nor will they make it as easy as Apple and Microsoft make to shut off ad personalization.  No regulator will take care of that: It's not their goal to kill off the ad-based business model and with it Facebook and Google, and the model won't work without data collection and ad targeting.  The only real guarantee that companies won't go overboard in invading customers' privacy is that they have large revenue streams which make it an unnecessary risk. Apple is reliable in this regard: It's a hardware company that also sells content and software on commission and on a subscription basis. Microsoft, with its cloud, software licensing and subscription businesses, is even less likely to go rogue in data collection because it no longer has a mobile platform to speak of.  That's why Microsoft and Apple aren't suffering much from the Cambridge Analytica-triggered tech sell-off. Microsoft shares are up 4.5 percent since the beginning of the year, Apple shares are down just 1.63 percent. That compares to Google's 4.6 percent drop and Facebook's 13.3 percent dive. I believe the gains made by Twitter and Snap, two companies fully dependent on ads and information-gathering, are a temporary fluke: They aren't as frequently mentioned in connection with data harvesting as Google and Facebook. As heavier regulation of the ad model becomes reality, they will inevitably suffer as much as their ad-based peers.  Monetization through ads was the only relatively easy choice for companies not offering any products or services that people wanted to buy. That revenue stream, however, is not as easy to hold on to as those coming directly from customers. Those of us who remember the fat days of ad-financed media know that better than anyone. The tech firms that fell back on ads will need to offer value to customers, not advertisers, as the best \"legacy\" media companies have learned to do.

The law, enacted March 23 as part of the massive spending bill, lays out rules for international data requests by law enforcement. It gives tech companies an easier way to navigate conflicts between government demands and customer privacy expectations.  The Supreme Court case, which the justices heard in February, stemmed from the government\u2019s use of a 1986 law to seek emails from an unidentified account kept on a Microsoft Corp. server in Ireland.

Many developed economies have actually seen productivity stagnate or decline.    A survey from Microsoft Corp. is bolstering one theory about this disconnect. In a poll of 20,000 European workers released Monday, Microsoft, which became one of the world\u2019s most profitable companies by marketing office productivity software, acknowledges new digital technology can, in some circumstances, sometimes not lead to any increase in productivity and actually result in less employee engagement with their work.    Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft joins a growing number of prominent Silicon Valley companies and entrepreneurs that are starting to question the social benefits of the technology they once championed. Facebook Inc. warned in December that its social network might, in some cases, cause psychological harm.    Microsoft identifies a number of instances where technology can be a drag on productivity, including: workers who are too distracted by a constant influx of e-mails, Slack messages, Trello notifications, texts, Tweets \u2013 not to mention viral cat videos \u2013 to concentrate for sustained periods; workers who aren\u2019t properly trained to use the new technology effectively; tech that isn\u2019t adequately supported by the business, forcing workers to lose time because \u201cthe computers are down;\u201d and workers who suffer burnout because, with mobile devices and at-home-working, they feel tethered to the job around-the-clock.    Of course, Microsoft isn\u2019t saying that technology dampens productivity in all cases. Instead, it says that tech\u2019s impact depends largely on the culture of the business. Those with a \u201cstrong digital culture\u201d saw productivity gains from technology while those with what Microsoft termed a \u201cweak digital culture\u201d didn\u2019t.    Microsoft defined companies with a strong digital culture as those where employees had proper training in the new technology, access to information, managers who promoted the adoption of new technology, and where executives conveyed to employees a clear sense of how the technology fit into the company\u2019s strategic vision.    In such businesses, about 22 percent of employees reported feeling highly productive and only about 5 percent reported feeling unproductive, compared with just 12 percent reporting they were highly productive and 21 percent feeling unproductive in companies deemed to have a weak digital culture. The study\u2019s authors noted that even 22 percent reporting high productivity \u201csuggests there is still more work that can be done to help every employee do their best work.\u201d    The survey also found digital culture had a big impact on how new technology changed employees\u2019 feelings of engagement with their work. In businesses with a strong digital culture, increased use of technology also boosted employees\u2019 feelings of passion and focus. But, in companies with a weak digital culture, it had the opposite effect: the more technology the company deployed, the less attached workers became.    In an introduction to the study, Michel van der Bel, Microsoft\u2019s president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said businesses should look at the adoption of new digital technology as \u201ca people journey\u201d and not just \u201can IT exercise.\u201d", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-05", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-05/microsoft-says-it-s-true-cat-videos-distract-workers"}, {"article": "The rapidly advancing area of artificial intelligence will require a new field of law and new regulations governing a growing pool of businesses involved, according to Microsoft Corp., a 25-year participant in AI research.  Companies making and selling AI software will need to be held responsible for potential harm caused by \u201cunreasonable practices\u201d \u2013 if a self-driving car program is set up in an unsafe manner that causes injury or death, for example, Microsoft said. And as AI and automation boost the number of laborers in the gig-economy or on-demand jobs, Microsoft said technology companies need to take responsibility and advocate for protections and benefits for workers, rather than passing the buck by claiming to be ``just the technology platform\u2019\u2019 enabling all this change.  Microsoft broaches these ideas in a 149-page book entitled \u201cThe Future Computed,\u201d which will also be the subject of a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next week. As Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft seeks to be a leader in AI and automating work tasks, it\u2019s also trying to get out in front of the challenges expected to arise from promising new technologies, such as job losses and everyday citizens who may be hurt or disadvantaged by malfunctioning or biased algorithms.  \u201cWe are trying to be clear-eyed in talking about the challenges,\u201d said Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith, who will sit on the Davos panel and co-wrote the introduction to the book.  Microsoft is working on some of these areas through groups such as the Partnership on AI, which includes rivals like Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. Still, the call for more regulation in an emerging area like AI is unusual for technology companies, said Ryan Calo, a professor at the University of Washington School of Law, who has read the book.  \u201cThere are a bunch of players in this space, and if you are Microsoft you want to be seen as trusted,\u201d said Calo, who did not assist the company on the book but has consulted for it on other issues and whose lab is partially funded with donations from Microsoft.

The development of laws will come a few years after that, Smith said.  In the nearer term, Microsoft is advocating for changes to labor laws to properly classify workers and allocate benefits like health care and retirement planning to people with jobs such as an Uber driver or Postmates delivery person. Smith expects there will be a need for a new category of worker to cover these employees, who are neither full-time nor independent contractors, he said.  \u201cThe technology industry needs to engage to change the perception that it reaps the benefits of technology progress at the expense of workers who are displaced or left without protections, benefits or long-term career paths,\u201d the company writes in the book. \u201cCompanies that do not acknowledge the importance of worker protections and benefits risk damage to their brands and face the possibility that lawmakers and the courts will step in to impose regulations.\u201d", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-18", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-18/microsoft-says-ai-advances-will-require-new-laws-regulations"}, {"article": "Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft Corp. and the second-richest person in the world, said there\u2019s a danger that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach could damage the U.S.\u2019s influence in Africa in the long term.

It\u2019s also a rare occasion for an Apple confab outside its home state of California.  A second grader works on an Apple Inc. iPad in Sandy, Utah. Photographer: George Frey/Bloomberg  In Chicago, the world\u2019s most-valuable technology company plans to show off a new version of its cheapest iPad that should appeal to the education market, said people familiar with the matter. The company will also showcase new software for the classroom, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private plans. Apple declined to comment.  Steve Jobs made schools a priority for Apple early in its life. But as the company has driven toward mass-market and higher-margin products in recent years, Google and Microsoft have had success breaking into classrooms with inexpensive laptops and tablets. Last year, the global educational technology market generated $17.7 billion in revenue, according to research firm Frost & Sullivan.  Apple accounted for 17 percent of mobile computing shipments to American students in kindergarten through high school, according to data from the third quarter published by Futuresource Consulting. Devices running Google\u2019s operating systems on Chromebooks or Android tablets held 60 percent of the market, and Windows PCs had 22 percent. While Macs and iPads make up less than 20 percent of Apple\u2019s sales combined, students and teachers are a key market to drive future purchases.  A new, cheaper MacBook laptop is in the works and likely destined to replace the MacBook Air at a price less than $1,000, but it probably won\u2019t be ready in time for next week, the people said. The MacBook Air, introduced about a decade ago, hasn\u2019t seen a major change since 2010, the same year the iPad came out. Although the laptop is popular with college students, it has languished as Apple focuses on more expensive Macs.  Rival laptops have made inroads into the education market lately, a field that originally helped Apple make its name. The sector is prized among industry giants because students learn to use a certain type of device, then head into the workforce and spread the technology wider.  With a recent advertising onslaught, Apple is hoping to capture more young minds with the iPad. The company has revised its tablet strategy over the years by releasing different versions at a variety of price points. That\u2019s helped the iPad business return to growth after multiple declining quarters. Still, demand for tablets is weak. According to research firm IDC, the market shrank by about 7 percent in 2017. Apple grew 3 percent last year and leads the industry with about a quarter of the market.  Apple's Tablet Roller Coaster iPad growth is returning after sales slowed for several quarters  Apple currently offers a slew of different education-related software. The company\u2019s Classroom app for the iPad lets teachers manage Apple devices that are assigned to students for their classwork. There\u2019s also an iTunes U app that lets teachers issue homework, grade assignments and post lessons online. It also lets students complete assignments and take tests. The company offers a software coding curriculum via the Swift Playgrounds app and sells interactive textbooks through its e-book store.  More software is coming. Apple is working on a new version of the iBooks app that\u2019s more in line with the design of the App Store, though it\u2019s unclear if it\u2019ll be shown next week, people familiar with the project have said.  In an invitation to the Chicago event, Apple said it will introduce \u201ccreative new ideas for teachers and students.\u201d Having a venue where attendees can see the new technology in action inside a classroom would be a sound strategy for a company that focuses its announcements on live demonstrations.  Next week\u2019s event will also provide an opportunity for Apple to boast about the work it\u2019s doing with Chicago schools. In December, the company partnered with the city\u2019s public school system and City Colleges of Chicago on a coding curriculum for thousands of local students. Apple has also discussed additional education-related programs with the city, people familiar with the talks said.  According to Apple\u2019s website, the school where the event will take place is not an \u201cApple Distinguished School,\u201d a designation given to institutions with curriculum that uses Apple products and provides iPads to all students.  Apple has tried citywide iPad deals for students in the past, with little success. In 2013, the Los Angeles Unified School District said it would spend $30 million to provide some students with iPads. The deal was expected to become a $1.3 billion initiative to give every student in the district an iPad, but it fell apart.  Such a deal won\u2019t be announced with Chicago next week, people familiar with the plans said. But the city could see more of Apple in the future. According to a recent Bloomberg analysis, the company could be eyeing the Midwest for a major new office.  \u2014 With assistance by Debby Wu", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-23", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-23/apple-will-return-to-its-roots-with-education-tools-and-new-ipad"}, {"article": "The tech industry takes on the Trump administration at the U.S. Supreme Court Tuesday in a high-stakes clash over digital privacy and government access to information stored on overseas servers.  At issue is whether federal and state law enforcement officials can use a decades-old law to demand user emails and other data held abroad by domestic companies including Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp.  The case calls on the justices to decide how a law older than the World Wide Web itself applies in the era of cloud computing. What they say could have sweeping consequences -- that is, unless Congress acts on pending proposals to overhaul the law and set out a more nuanced approach.  \u201cThe court is presented with two pretty stark choices,\u201d said Jennifer Daskal, a professor at American University\u2019s Washington College of Law. There are \u201cproblems with either side winning,\u201d she said.  The case stems from a federal effort to use the 1986 Stored Communications Act to get emails from an unidentified account kept on a Microsoft server in Ireland. The government, which says the emails would show evidence of drug trafficking, got a search warrant in 2013. Microsoft refused to turn over the information, deciding to fight the matter in court instead.  Beyond U.S. Borders  Microsoft says the government is improperly trying to use the 1986 law in a foreign country. The Supreme Court is generally loath to say a federal law applies beyond the U.S. borders.  The government is trying to \u201cunilaterally reach into a foreign land to search for copy and import private customer correspondence physically stored in a digital lockbox on a foreign computer where it\u2019s protected by foreign law,\u201d said Joshua Rosenkranz, the lawyer who\u2019ll will argue the case for Microsoft.  The Trump administration, which inherited the case from President Barack Obama\u2019s legal team, says it\u2019s not trying to apply the U.S. law overseas. Officials served the warrant on Microsoft at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington, and disclosure of the email content would occur domestically as well, U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in court papers.  The law \u201cfocuses on disclosure, and the disclosure of records from Microsoft to the government would occur in the United States,\u201d Francisco argued.  Microsoft stores email content at more than 100 data centers in more than 40 countries. The company says it uses so many sites for the sake of speed, putting users as close as possible to their data.  Most Frequent Location  At the time of the search, Microsoft\u2019s policy was to store email content in the data center nearest to the customer\u2019s self-declared country of residence. The company has since changed its system so that it relies on the user\u2019s most frequent location.  Other companies store their data differently. Google breaks files into pieces that get stored separately and are constantly being moved from place to place. Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are among the many tech companies supporting Microsoft.  Business groups say a ruling in favor of the government would prompt users to shun U.S. cloud service providers in favor of foreign-based companies that could offer stronger privacy protections.  Privacy advocates also say such a ruling would invite reciprocity by foreign governments, putting the data of American users at risk from those governments even if it\u2019s held on servers in the U.S.  \u201cIf we say our process works abroad, you can bet that the rest of the world is going to say its process works here,\u201d said Greg Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington.  \u2018Slow and Uncertain\u2019  The Trump administration says the consequences would be greater if the U.S. were to lose. Although the government would still be able to invoke treaties with some nations to get legal help, the administration says those cover less than half the world\u2019s countries and often mean a \u201cslow and uncertain\u201d process.  States also can use the Stored Communications Act, and 35 of them -- though not tech-heavy California or Microsoft\u2019s home state of Washington -- filed a brief backing the federal government.  \u201cThe business decisions of private corporations should not control whether law enforcement can obtain evidence of crimes committed in their jurisdictions,\u201d the states argued.  The all-or-nothing nature of the Supreme Court dispute is one reason people on both sides are urging Congress to step in, possibly even before the court can rule.  A bipartisan proposal known as the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act, or Cloud Act, has support from both Microsoft and the Justice Department. It would make clear that U.S. warrants apply around the world, while also setting up a new process for providers to challenge warrants. The law also would put in place new rules for American companies when they receive information requests from foreign governments.  \u201cThe court doesn\u2019t have the tools to figure out the best balance,\u201d said Rosenkranz, the lawyer for Microsoft. \u201cIt\u2019s a policy decision that requires a scalpel, and all the court has is a meat cleaver.\u201d  The case is United States v. Microsoft, 17-2.  \u2014 With assistance by Ben Brody, and Dina Bass", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-26", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-26/tech-takes-on-trump-as-supreme-court-looks-at-data-stored-abroad"}, {"article": "Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Apple Inc. have thrown their support behind proposals in Congress to deal with cross-border data requests from law enforcement -- even as the issue heads for review before the U.S. Supreme Court.  The companies, along with Facebook Inc. and Oath Inc., on Tuesday signed letters welcoming bipartisan House and Senate versions of the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act, or Cloud Act.  Separately, according to a statement from the office of British Prime Minister Theresa May, President Donald Trump told May on Tuesday that passing the proposals was \"vital\" to the two countries\u2019 security.  The White House said in its own statement that Trump and May would \"advocate for legislation\" around a pending data agreement like the one in the congressional proposals. The White House, however, did not mention a specific bill.  The Cloud Act, according to a statement from its sponsors, would allow the U.S. to make agreements with foreign countries for dealing with law enforcement requests.  The legislation would also make clear that U.S. warrants apply around the world, while allowing technology companies to notify foreign governments of any requests -- as well as a process for challenging them.  \"The new, bipartisan Cloud Act is an important step toward enhancing & protecting privacy while reducing international legal conflicts,\" Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith tweeted on Tuesday.  In October, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case stemming from a 2013 request by federal authorities for data held overseas by Microsoft and other companies. Microsoft has refused to turn over the information, calling for a legislative solution. It has supported previous legislative proposals on the issue.  The Justice Department supports the legislation, Representative Doug Collins of Georgia said in the sponsors\u2019 statement. The White House and Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday evening.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is also supporting the proposals, while the Center for Democracy & Technology, a policy institute in Washington, objected that they do not do \"enough to protect the privacy of internet users\" and would \"erode trust in the privacy of data stored in the cloud.\"  In October, Microsoft dropped another lawsuit against the Justice Department over the privacy of customer data after the department moved to scale back the use of orders forcing technology companies to turn over data without alerting users.  \u2014 With assistance by Dina Bass", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-07", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-07/tech-companies-welcome-cross-border-data-search-legislation"}, {"article": "In the 1990's, the U.S. only had one purported monopolist to worry about, Microsoft Corp. Now we have at least three, Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc.  It's almost too many to be angry about at once.  Two notable magazine pieces dug into the power of these tech giants this month. Both articles are worth sitting down with when you have some time. Last week, Wired looked at Facebook's handling of Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election, capturing growing animosity that seems to be coming at the company from all corners lately.  On Tuesday, the New York Times Magazine published \"The Case Against Google.\" The piece recounts how Google crushed a small search competitor and how the European Commission stepped into the regulatory void to fine Google $2.7 billion. (Google is appealing).  The most compelling part is the depiction of regulators' fight with Microsoft: Even though they failed to punish Microsoft in any meaningful way, the media scrutiny, paired with antitrust monitors, had a significant effect on the company's behavior -- simply because employees got nervous.    \"Microsoft was so powerful, and Google so new, that the young search engine could have been killed off, some insiders at both companies believe,\" the author writes. He quotes Gene Burrus, a former Microsoft lawyer: \u201cThere was a new culture of compliance, and we didn\u2019t want to get in trouble again, so nothing happened.\" The piece questions the myth that Google humbled Microsoft on its own. \"The government\u2019s antitrust lawsuit is one reason that Google was eventually able to break Microsoft\u2019s monopoly.\"  But today Google, despite the historic fine it faces, doesn't seem scared. I suspect the company realizes it isn't enemy number one, at least in the U.S. While regulators might have the most legitimate antitrust case against Google, as demonstrated by the EU decision, rising ill-will toward tech giants and their billionaire leaders isn't focused on the search giant. That scrutiny is falling more on Facebook for reasons that have little to do with antitrust violations.  Politicians and others are hammering Facebook for fake content and a broader lack of authenticity. But it's important to note that the company is part of a growing digital advertising duopoly with Google in the U.S. If attention is the new economy online, they dominate our time spent. If it's data about our lives, they have the most of that, too.  And we haven't event talked about Amazon yet. Cities are prostrating themselves at the company's feet, trying to secure its second headquarters. Amazon can do no wrong in consumers' eyes. But if you talk to bankers or business people, Amazon is the one that strikes the most fear in their hearts. It controls more than two-thirds of the U.S. e-book market now. Amazon alone has the stock market's support to enter new industries, drive margins to zero and destroy rivals in search of more scale. It's great for shoppers and terrifying if you're in the grocery or pharmaceutical business.  So if you're a politician looking to quell public concern, or a regulator trying to even the online playing field, what do you do? Do you go after Facebook, the most-derided in the group of late? Do you go after Amazon, whose growth is so staggering that it is responsible for 27 percent of the S&P 500's gains so far this year? Or do you go after Google, a company that makes it easier to figure out where to get the best burrito -- even if that information used to be scraped without permission from reviews at rival Yelp? Or do you make some noise, then end up doing nothing?  This article also ran in Bloomberg Technology\u2019s Fully Charged newsletter.

The Trump administration is challenging a lower-court ruling that barred federal law enforcement officials from using the 1986 Stored Communications Act to get a suspected drug trafficker\u2019s emails, which were kept on a Microsoft server in Ireland. During an hour-long argument, the justices struggled to decide how a law older than the World Wide Web affects law enforcement in the era of cloud computing.  Chief Justice John Roberts suggested Microsoft\u2019s argument would put out of the government\u2019s reach an email sent from the Supreme Court building to someone just a block away, if the company had chosen to store it on a server outside the U.S.  Nothing would keep Microsoft \"from storing United States communications, every one of them, either in Canada or Mexico or anywhere else, and then telling their customers: Don\u2019t worry if the government wants to get access to your communications; they won\u2019t be able to,\" without getting help from a from foreign government, Roberts told Microsoft lawyer Joshua Rosenkranz.  Justice Samuel Alito expressed concern that law enforcement would be hobbled without the ability to demand offshore emails from companies located in the U.S.  He asked what happens when a U.S. citizen is being investigated for crimes in this country, and the government has shown it has an \"urgent need\" for \"evidence of this crime in emails that are in the possession of an American internet service provider\" that has stored the emails overseas.  Rosenkranz said U.S. prosecutors would ask for help from that country\u2019s government. \"If it\u2019s urgent for the government, the other governments respond urgently,\" he said.  Microsoft, which is supported in the case by companies including Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., stores email content at more than 100 data centers in more than 40 countries. The company says it uses that many sites for the sake of speed, putting users as close as possible to their data.  Proposal in Congress  The government says that requesting assistance from other countries in gathering evidence can be a slow and difficult process. Fewer than half of the world\u2019s countries have treaties with the U.S. for providing such help.  Several of the Democratic-nominated justices expressed frustration with applying the the decades-old law to the era of cloud computing, suggesting they might prefer to wait for Congress to act on a pending bipartisan proposal to update the law.  Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested to Deputy U.S. Solicitor General Michael Dreeben that the government\u2019s interpretation of the law would raise conflicts with the data privacy laws of other countries.  \"Why shouldn\u2019t we leave the status quo as it is and let Congress pass a bill in this new age that addresses the potential problems that your reading would create?\" Sotomayor asked, following up on a similar question from Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  \u2018Break the Cloud\u2019  Rosenkranz, the Microsoft lawyer, told the justices that a ruling could damage the standing of the U.S. as the world leader in the multibillion-dollar cloud computing business.  \"If you try to tinker with this without the tools that -- that only Congress has, you are as likely to break the cloud as you are to fix it,\" he said.  Attending Tuesday\u2019s argument was Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, a cosponsor of the bipartisan measure, which would let the U.S. make formal agreements with other countries for cross-border requests for digital evidence. After the argument, Hatch said in a statement, \"It\u2019s no surprise that throughout this morning\u2019s oral argument, justices continually referred to the importance of action from Congress.\"  The case is United States v.

A timing quirk in the tax overhaul seemed to give companies such as Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. -- all of which began their fiscal years before Jan. 1 -- the chance to reduce the foreign cash they\u2019ll accumulate this year and lower their taxes. A press release issued by the IRS on Monday indicates that \u201cif done in the ordinary course of business,\u201d the move won\u2019t be considered as tax avoidance, according to Stephen Shay, a tax and business law professor at Harvard Law School.  \u201cThe light is green for this planning, not red,\u201d said Shay, a former top Treasury official. \u201cIt is great for those whose years beginning before 2018 are still open for the planning.\u201d  While companies taking steps to shift their assets would still owe repatriation taxes, they wouldn\u2019t have as much cash taxed at the higher rate -- \"a major concession\" by the IRS, said independent tax and accounting expert Robert Willens.  The tax law signed by President Donald Trump in December overhauled the international tax system and requires companies to pay a mandatory two-tiered levy on their accumulated foreign income. Cash is taxed at 15.5 percent, while less liquid assets face a rate of 8 percent. Companies have been trying to figure out ways to reduce assets subject to the higher rate.  Another provision in the IRS release also allows multinationals some leeway when calculating their repatriation tax bills. The law appeared to make more foreign entities owned by multinationals subject to the repatriation tax, but the agency said Monday that taxpayers that own less than 5 percent of a foreign entity\u2019s capital or profits won\u2019t be hit by the repatriation tax.  \u2018Pro-Taxpayer\u2019 Notice  Banks and financial institutions will also see a reprieve following the IRS\u2019s guidance that a company\u2019s accounts receivable and accounts payable that are longer than one year will be exempt from the repatriation tax, said John Warner, a tax partner at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney PC. The financial firms had feared the payments under the loans they issue would have faced the 15.5 percent rate, since they\u2019re generally considered accounts receivable, regardless of their maturities.  \"This is generally pro-taxpayer,\" Warner said.  Still, the agency said it would crack down on some strategies multinationals may use to reduce their offshore tax bills, such as artificially reducing their earnings and profits, cash piles or \"pro-rata\" share of transactions, for foreign entities they have stakes in, own or control.  Those rules will be a big deal to some companies, said Michael Mundaca, the co-director of Ernst & Young\u2019s Washington National tax practice and a former top Treasury Department tax official.

Sales of all devices are stagnating, but the time may have arrived for a hybrid gadget.  It seemed like such a good idea, in theory. And it still seems like a good idea -- again, in theory.  Microsoft Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. are pitching computers that mix elements of tablets and smartphones. That means, in principle, people will soon be able to buy a device that works like a familiar Windows laptop but with the slimmer and lighter form of a tablet computer plus the built-in cellular connections and long battery life of a smartphone.  You might be thinking, that sounds similar to an iPad Pro or Microsoft's own line of Surface computers. Yup. And all these gadgets also owe a debt of gratitude to the MacBook Air, the skinny, battery-conserving laptop Apple Inc. introduced a decade ago.  There's a reason I'm curious but cautious about this category of devices that blend elements of PCs, tablets and smartphones. There have been cellular-connected lightweight computers on the market for years, off and on, including devices powered by Microsoft and Qualcomm five years ago. They never caught on. This time, though, these hybrid devices are a category whose time has come. I think.  Powering Down Personal computer sales peaked in 2011 and have declined each year since Source: IDC  Even as smartphones have become the most important digital devices, there has been much welcome innovation in computers. New technology from PC chip king Intel Corp. and Microsoft's 2012 introduction of the Surface spurred fresh ideas about what a \"computer\" could be.  The Surface has a touchscreen like a smartphone and a detachable keyboard that turns the device into a somewhat compromised tablet-laptop hybrid. Microsoft sold more than $2 billion worth of the gadgets in the six months ended Dec. 31, and some traditional PC makers have found traction with these combo machines, too.  The Surface was followed by the iPad Pro, a similar tablet-plus-keyboard with the heart of a smartphone. Google software supports stripped-down laptops called Chromebooks that have been a huge hit in U.S. schools. These are all relatively recent and welcome reimaginations of conventional computers.  They're not perfect for everyone or every use, but the mixed-up world of computers gives people more choices to find the right devices for them. A PC-tablet hybrid with a fast wireless internet connection is a welcome addition to that stew of options, although there are unanswered questions about the performance and drawbacks of the new machines backed by Microsoft and Qualcomm.  It's also an odd time to be devoting resources to any new type of computer hardware. Global sales of personal computers have dropped for each of the past six years, according to research firm IDC. The research firm's PC data don't include devices like the Surface that have detachable keyboards. Tablet sales are also declining, and smartphone sales have hit a wall. It's not halcyon days for most companies that make computing gadgets.  Hardware Hits a Wall Global sales of computers, tablets and smartphones all declined in 2017. Change in unit shipments from the prior year: Source: IDC  Still, you can see the appeal of trying new concepts in computing. Even if PCs and tablets aren't growth categories, more than 400 million of these gadgets are still sold each year. And each player in the market has its own motivations. Qualcomm, for example, sees greenfield opportunity if it can displace Intel in more PC-type devices.  The big question now is how much of a push the latest cellular-connected PCs will get from their backers. There\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm for the next generation of cellular technology called 5G, which optimists say will usher in a new era of internet-connected devices of all kinds. Intel said on Thursday that it is also collaborating with Microsoft and others to introduce a line of 5G-connected computing devices. The backing of Microsoft, Qualcomm and Intel should bolster the idea of blending smartphones, tablets and computers.

Now, that group is bearing its first fruit: Microsoft Genomics, a gene-sequencing service developed with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.  Microsoft Healthcare NExT head Dr. Peter Lee says the challenges are hard, but there are lots of benefits, tangible and otherwise, to this healthcare push.  A year ago, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella tasked Microsoft Research NExT \u2014 the company's A-team of troubleshooting scientists \u2014 with a new mission: Take the company's most cutting-edge tech and apply it to improving healthcare.  Microsoft Healthcare NExT head and corporate VP Dr. Peter Lee tells Business Insider that this new mandate was so broad, it was a little bit like being dropped in the middle of the ocean and told to find dry land.  \"There's no sign of which way is the right way, and you could swim really far in any one direction before realizing you were going astray.\" And, of course, he says, healthcare is a field that many tech companies have tried to tackle, and failed. You might think you're making progress, but \"then you look down and see the people drowning.\"  \"There was a time where we were just floundering,\" Lee says.  Now, though, Lee feels like Microsoft's efforts have finally begun to bear fruit, in the form of real, actual products that are making a difference to healthcare organizations, hospitals \u2014 and patients' lives.  For instance, on Wednesday, Microsoft announced the general availability of Microsoft Genomics, a gene-sequencing service available to doctors and researchers via the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. That platform was born directly out of joint research between Microsoft and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.  Microsoft researchers discuss Microsoft Genomics, the company's new gene-sequencing tool, powered by the Microsoft Azure cloud. Microsoft  \"We already got one product out of this push,\" says Lee.  Similarly, Microsoft is announcing the availability and expansion of other partnership-driven services. Microsoft and India's Apollo Hospitals teamed up for a new artificially-intelligent system for detecting tell-tale signs of heart disease in patient data, for instance; it also partnered up with UPMC for Project Empower MD, a note-taking tool for doctors.  Lee says it's been extremely rewarding: The biggest motivator for his team is getting to make a difference in people's lives. Plus, Healthcare NExT gets to work with cutting-edge technology, like Microsoft's partnership with Seattle-based Adaptive Biotechnologies, which is attempting to use AI to detect cancers and other serious maladies with a simple blood test.  \"It's just cool beyond belief,\" says Lee of Adaptive.  Lee says there are more material rewards, too, as these products open new markets for Microsoft \u2014 important, as some analysts estimate that healthcare cloud computing could be a $35 billion market by 2020.  Doctors, surgeons, and researchers have long needed these kinds of tools, says Lee, and Microsoft is happy to deliver. He says healthcare is becoming a \"very large business\" for Microsoft.  \"We don't talk publicly about the dollars, but it's large,\" says Lee.  Not drowning yet  The key that helped Microsoft Healthcare NExT find its way was to take a bigger-picture approach, says Lee. The starting point was to look at the so-called \"hyperscale\" clouds from Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, and try to picture what the world would be like without them.  With that in mind, Lee says, Microsoft started making bets. The Microsoft NExT \"standard playbook\" revolves around forming individual, internal \"startups\" with their own funding and purpose-driven mandates, so the engineers and scientists on the team got organized and got moving.  Some of those self-styled \"startups\" started using the Microsoft Azure cloud to provide gene-sequencing supercomputing power, resulting in the service now known as Microsoft Genomics. Others focused on neonatal care, or better software for doctors, or improved ways to take patient measurements.  St. Jude researchers use Microsoft Genomics. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital  In all cases, Lee says, the key was for Microsoft to work closely with patients \u2014 as they did with St. Jude for Microsoft Genomics.  \"We appreciate that Microsoft is investing in genomic research and that they took the time to understand and appreciate our unique mission at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital: finding cures and saving children,\" St. Jude CIO Keith Perry told Business Insider via e-mail.  And for his part, Lee says the team has found a lot of \"inspiration\" in working directly with healthcare providers, and the patients they service. In working on Microsoft Genomics, he says, he and his team have made several pediatric cancer patients \u2014 renewing their drive to do better, faster. He says it's \"incredibly motivating.\"  Which is good, because he says Microsoft has \"found its way forward.\" There's no more floundering, he says, just promising movement in the right direction. For instance, Lee's group is now working on an intelligent chatbot for pharmacies that can help patients reorder prescriptions and answer questions about their medications.  As for himself, Lee describes himself as a \"second-year grad student\" \u2014 he's accumulated enough knowledge in the healthcare space to understand what the experts on his team are talking about and make decisions, but not enough to weigh in and participate in the research himself.  Still, he says, he's learning fast. And if he hasn't quite found dry land, he says he's beyond just treading water.  \"I haven't drowned yet,\" says Lee.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-28", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/peter-lee-microsoft-research-healthcare-next-interview-2018-2"}, {"article": "FILE PHOTO - A Microsoft logo is seen a day after Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn Corp (LNKD.N), in Los Angeles Thomson Reuters By Dan Levine and Salvador Rodriguez  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A senior executive said Microsoft Corp thoroughly investigates issues raised by women in the workplace and fired about 20 employees last year over complaints of sexual harassment as the company seeks to counter claims that it treats female workers unfairly.  In an email to employees publicly released late on Thursday, Microsoft Chief People Officer Kathleen Hogan said Microsoft had 83 harassment complaints in 2017 out of a U.S.-based workforce of over 65,000 employees.  Nearly 50 percent were found to be supported at least in part following an investigation, she said, and more than half of those resulted in the termination of an employee who engaged in unacceptable behavior.  The unusual publication of such data comes as the world's largest software company is defending a lawsuit which alleges it systematically denied pay raises or promotions to women. Microsoft denies it has ever had such a policy.  The lawsuit, filed in Seattle federal court in 2015, is attracting wider attention after a series of powerful men have left or been fired from their jobs in entertainment, the media and politics for sexual misconduct.  Microsoft also investigated 84 complaints of gender discrimination last year, Hogan said, and found around 10 percent of those to be supported at least in part.  Earlier this week, Reuters reported on the contents of unsealed court documents which showed that out of 118 gender discrimination complaints filed by women in U.S.-based technical jobs at Microsoft between 2010 and 2016, only one was deemed \"founded\" by the company.  Attorneys for the women described the number of complaints as \"shocking\" in the court filings, and said the response by Microsoft's investigations team was \"lackluster.\"  Hogan's email on Thursday linked to the Reuters story and said the numbers cited by plaintiffs were misleading.  \"Reports that we rarely reach a conclusion in favor of the complainant are based on a faulty reading of a partial data set,\" Hogan wrote.  Hogan's email did not provide additional figures about the time period cited in the court documents.  The plaintiffs based their numbers on documents disclosed by Microsoft during pre-trial discovery in the lawsuit. Kelly Dermody, an attorney for the plaintiffs, declined to comment on Hogan's email.  Alaina Percival, chief executive of Women Who Code, an organization that helps companies increase their number of women developers, said publicly releasing this kind of data can help businesses learn from each other about the best ways to handle sexual harassment and gender discrimination.  \"I think other tech companies should follow suit, and I would expect to see that happen,\" Percival said.

Booty's job will be to execute Spencer's strategy within the six studios, as part of a company-wide effort to juice up its global gaming strength.  Microsoft has named Matt Booty the new corporate VP of Microsoft Studios, the division that incorporates Xbox and all of its gaming efforts.  As VentureBeat first reported, Booty was one of the key people in Microsoft's \"Minecraft\" business, and his promotion is crucial to the company's overall gaming strategy and ambition.  Back in September, CEO Satya Nadella appointed previous Microsoft Studios VP Phil Spencer as an executive VP in the company's top board, alongside the people overseeing Windows 10, the Surface brand, the Office 365 suite, and more.  This move had left the position vacant, and Booty is now stepping up to fill in.

The figure was cited by plaintiffs suing Microsoft for systematically denying pay raises or promotions to women at the world's largest software company. Microsoft denies it had any such policy.  The lawsuit, filed in Seattle federal court in 2015, is attracting wider attention after a series of powerful men have left or been fired from their jobs in entertainment, the media and politics for sexual misconduct.  Plaintiffs' attorneys are pushing to proceed as a class action lawsuit, which could cover more than 8,000 women. More details about Microsoft's human resources practices were made public on Monday in legal filings submitted as part of that process.  The two sides are exchanging documents ahead of trial, which has not been scheduled.  Out of 118 gender discrimination complaints filed by women at Microsoft, only one was deemed \"founded\" by the company, according to details in the unsealed court filings.  Attorneys for the women called the number of complaints \"shocking\" in the court filings and the response by Microsoft's investigations team \"lackluster.\"  Companies generally keep information about internal discrimination complaints private, so it is unclear how the number of complaints at Microsoft compares to competitors.  Microsoft said in court filings that the plaintiffs did not identify practices that impact enough employees to warrant a class action, and that it spends more than $55 million per year to promote diversity and inclusion. The company had about 74,000 U.S. employees at the end of last year.  Microsoft said the plaintiffs cannot cite one example of a pay or promotion problem in which Microsoft's investigations team should have found a violation of company policy, but did not. A Microsoft spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment.  U.S. District Judge James Robart has not yet ruled on the plaintiffs' request for class action status.  A Reuters review of federal court cases filed between 2006 and 2016 revealed hundreds containing sexual harassment allegations where companies used common civil litigation tactics to keep potentially damning information under wraps.  Microsoft had argued that the number of womens' human resources complaints should be kept secret because publicizing the outcomes could deter employees from reporting future abuses.

On Monday, a court issued a temporary restraining order which prevents McIntyre from working at Microsoft until further notice.  Using Microsoft's own arguments from a previous lawsuit, IBM is arguing that its diversity strategy is both confidential and \"potentially damaging\" if shared with its competitors.  Tech companies have a less than stellar record hiring women and minorities. But these companies will apparently do whatever it takes \u2014 including launching a legal fight \u2014 to hire one type of person: a Chief Diversity Officer.  IBM is suing its former top diversity officer Lindsay-Rae McIntyre after she got poached by Microsoft, in a case that could prove just how important diversity, recruitment, and retention has become for tech companies.  McIntyre, who joined IBM in 2006, was named chief diversity officer of Microsoft on Sunday, after serving in the same role and as VP of human resources at IBM. IBM, in its complaint, argues that McIntyree had access to diversity data, strategies, methodologies and initiatives that are confidential, and that she \"will use, rely on or divulge\" these strategies in her new role.  On Monday, IBM was granted a temporary restraining order in New York federal court, which prevents McIntyre from working for Microsoft until the court decides otherwise.  \"McIntyre was at the center of highly confidential and competitively sensitive information that has fueled IBM's success in these areas,\" a representative for IBM said in a statement. \"While we understand Microsoft's need to deal with mounting criticism of its record on diversity, IBM intends to fully enforce Ms. McIntyre's non-compete agreement to protect our competitive information.\"  IBM is using another Microsoft lawsuit to argue its case  At the heart of IBM's complaint is an on-going lawsuit from 2015, Moussouris v. Microsoft Corporation. The lawsuit alleges that Microsoft systematically discriminated against women in technical and engineering roles at the company when it came to evaluations, pay, and promotions.  The briefings for that lawsuit wrapped up on February 9. Now it is up to the courts to decide whether or not the case has class-action status.  As part of its non-compete case, IBM is looking to use Microsoft's own legal arguments from the Moussouris lawsuit to make its own point.  In April 2017, to prevent certain information from being released publicly in the discovery process, Microsoft argued that such diversity data is \"not merely confidential, but so sensitive and potentially damaging to Microsoft if revealed to its competitors (e.g., IBM), that the court should take the extraordinary measure of putting the information under seal,\" according to IBM's complaint.  Microsoft ultimately got some of the documents in the case sealed, and others released with redactions.  In its official response to IBM, Microsoft argued that enforcing McIntyre's non-compete agreement is \"draconian,\" as McIntyre has promised not to share confidential information with Microsoft.  It's worth noting that IBM's employee ranks are not a paragon of diversity: According to IBM's website, women comprised 31.8% of its global workforce in 2016.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-12", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-hired-chief-diversity-officer-ibm-suing-2018-2"}, {"article": ".

As \"deal-maker-in-chief,\" Peggy Johnson gets paid millions to help make Microsoft billions.  Her actual title is executive vice president for business development, and she's helped lead over 40 investments with Microsoft Ventures. One deal was the acquisition of LinkedIn \u2014 for $26 billion.  \"It takes an army for sure,\" Johnson said on Business Insider's podcast, \"Success!

Microsoft's Peggy Johnson, right, spoke with Business Insider US Editor-in-Chief Alyson Shontell at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Switzerland, in January 2018. Business Insider  To understand Peggy Johnson and the qualities that have made her successful, you have to know about her family. She was the 14th of 15 kids. As a child she was a quiet listener who learned to read her siblings' facial expressions from the kitchen countertop (with so many people, her chair wouldn't fit around the family table). Eventually Johnson followed some of her brothers and sisters to San Diego State University, where she started studying business, even though she really loved math and science. It was there that a chance encounter changed her life's trajectory.  Peggy Johnson: My parents had two rules: You had to go to college, and you had to pay for it yourself. So we all did. I was delivering mail and happened to deliver mail to the engineering department one day. Two ladies at the end of this long hallway with linoleum floors could hear me coming, and they were super excited to see me \u2014 like more excited than they should've been just because I was delivering mail.  It was because they thought I was there to ask about engineering. And they were disappointed. They said, \"We thought you wanted to know something about the School of Engineering.\" I said, \"Nope \u2014 just delivering the mail.\" They said, \"Well, do you know anything about engineering?,\" and I said, \"You know, absolutely nothing.\"  No one had ever really talked to me about engineering, and so they asked me the same question, \"Do you like math and science?\" I said, \"I love it.\" They just started to work on me, and after 15 to 20 minutes I felt, like, \"You know, this might be something I want to do.\"  The next day I changed my major to engineering \u2014 yeah, to electrical engineering.  Alyson Shontell: Wow.  Johnson: I credit those two ladies. They just, you know, worked on me and changed my mind.  Shontell: They changed your life.  Johnson: My life. The whole trajectory of my life really changed in that conversation.  Shontell: So you wound up getting a job at GE after this great electrical-engineering major. And you spent a couple years there.  Johnson: Yeah, I started as an intern while I was still at school, and again, San Diego State put me on a great course because they had a number of great internship opportunities, and this area of General Electric was in their military electronics division. I worked on anti-submarine warfare for surface ships. So it sounds very interesting, I'm sure. You want to know more about that, but I can't say anything because I had a clearance.  But it was a job I might still be in today if not for it seemed like it was going to move to Syracuse, New York, and of course I was in San Diego, California, but I didn't want to move, and well, \"I've got to look for a job here in San Diego,\" and ended up saying no to GE.  Johnson spent 25 years working her way up the ladder  Johnson worked at Qualcomm for 25 years on both the technical engineering side and the business side. Thomson Reuters  Shontell: Is that when you went to Qualcomm?  Johnson: Yes, and I just answered an ad in the newspaper, which they don't do anymore. You probably never even heard of that, but yes, that's how you used to get jobs, look through the newspaper.  Shontell: In the classifieds.  Johnson: The classifieds, and there it was. It was this new company, and they were hiring, and my husband had had an internship at the predecessor to Qualcomm, called Linkabit. He said, \"You know, Irwin Jacobs is an amazing man.\" He had owned and been in Linkabit, and he said, \"I don't know what Qualcomm does, but I think you should \u2014 \"  Shontell: He's the founder of Qualcomm?  Johnson: Irwin Jacobs is, yeah. And so prodded by my husband, who was at that time pursuing his master's degree, and we were married, and one of us needed to work, and that was me. So I went in, had an interview. Hardest interview of my life, and ended up getting the job, and stayed there for 25 years.  Shontell: Yeah, it's incredible. But while you had a long career there, at first it seemed as if you were soft-spoken and it was hard to kind of get your point across in a loud room with those guys.  Johnson: It was.  And I'm soft-spoken probably going back to the family experience. Number 14 out of 15 wasn't an enviable position to be in. You were just one of so many voices at the table, and I was one who had to sit at the side table. So I was at the kids' table until I was, like, 24 years old.  So I was more of a listener, and I was quiet largely because I couldn't ever really break in to that chaos at the big table. But I was a listener and I would watch people, and I would try to understand their mood. Those skills were what I brought into my job at Qualcomm, and maybe not great skills, because when I got to Qualcomm the expectation really at that time was, \"You need to speak up more. You need to be more assertive in meetings. We want to hear from you more.\" Whenever I did that, whenever I tried to be what I wasn't, it didn't really turn out very well, and I didn't feel very authentic, and in fact people would kind of look at me \u2014 \"Why is she being so assertive and aggressive here? That's not like her.\" And it wasn't. It wasn't my authentic self.  So pretty much I had decided, \"I think I have to leave the industry, the company. I'm just not suited for this.\" My manager at the time said, \"No, we are going to figure this out. You're going to stay right where you are,\" and really I credit him for making a lot of changes in the HR department at the time because we were ranked by certain attributes that I didn't have. So I remember being marked off for not being aggressive and assertive in meetings, and he said, \"We are going to change this, and we are going to make sure we have a broader set of qualities that we're looking for.\" Things like teamwork and being collaborative, and he really pushed. It was early, early days, and things changed from that point on. Once I was able to be my more authentic self I felt like that's when my career really took off. I was just my own voice.  Shontell: Yes, so he sort of gave you permission to be yourself and helped you find your own leadership style.  Johnson: He did, yes. I always credit him for that because I might have just left like, I think, a lot of women did at the time. They just didn't feel comfortable and it didn't feel like a very inclusive environment, and he helped change that.  Shontell: So you go on to stay for many, many more years at Qualcomm \u2014 25 years.  Johnson: Yes.  Shontell: What made you so dedicated to that one company?  Johnson: Right, yes. So first of all, Qualcomm's a great company, and they gave me the opportunity to really thrive in a number of roles. So I was an engineer to start with, and I was in the engineering department for several years. Then I had been going out on business trips because we needed to explain the product to the industry we were selling into, and on one of the flights home the general manager happens to be sitting next to me and he said, \"I don't understand. Why don't you just come over to the business side? You really seem to love doing that, and I like the way you translate the technical world into the business world. I think you could be well suited for that.\"  And I thought, \"Well, thank you very much but no, thank you. I'm an engineer.\" I identified with being an engineer, and I remember thinking engineering at that time at Qualcomm was in one building, and all the business people were in the other building, and we made fun of them all the time because they dressed up, and we got to wear our Qualcomm shirts and jeans. We thought we didn't want to have anything to do with that world, but it started to weigh on me, and probably four or five weeks went by, and I remember sitting at our holiday party, and all of sudden I had one of those aha moments, and it was:\" \"You need to do this. You need to make that leap.\" Because while I liked what I did, I loved being in front of the customer. So I did, and I moved over into program management, which is sort of a technical and business role, and that was really the start of my business career at Qualcomm.  Shontell: So you switched from engineering to the business-development side, and that's when things really took off.  Johnson: Yeah, and I think part of it was the time. It was early days of the mobile phones. We were making the digital standard that was eventually embedded into mobile phones in the US, and so everything was exciting and new. We were forging new paths, and it was such a great time to be at the start of a business. None of us had any idea what it would turn into. I don't think any of us at that time envisioned that everybody would be carrying cellphones. I mean, we thought, \"That'll be a good business. Maybe a few million of those will sell.\" So it was fun to be there at the start of that, but I had great managers along the way, and any time I wanted to do something different they really supported me.  Shontell: And switching careers isn't easy. I mean, it's a big risk.  Johnson: Exactly. It is, and you're not quite sure, and if it doesn't work out, can I go back? Once I switched over I had to learn a lot. Clearly I didn't have a business degree, and a lot of it was on-the-job learning, but I had some great mentors and folks who leaned in and helped me. And I just loved every hat I wore after that point, until I moved on to Microsoft from Qualcomm.  How Johnson decided to make the leap and start a new career at Microsoft  Johnson was recruited by Satya Nadella as his first big hire after becoming Microsoft's CEO in 2014. Microsoft  Shontell: It sounds like you had a great setup. You established yourself through the ranks, had great mentorship. So Microsoft calls. You'd been rejecting other calls before, kind of just hanging up the phone on recruiters. What was it about Microsoft?  Johnson: Well, I wouldn't call them back. I wouldn't hang up on them.  Shontell: OK: You were polite about it.  Johnson: That's it. But it was one of those interesting times. I hadn't ever called any back because everything was great at Qualcomm. I loved it, and also I was living in San Diego, my family was there. Everything was fantastic, but at the time of the industry Satya had just taken over, Satya Nadella, as CEO of Microsoft. We did business with Microsoft. We sold them chips, and so we know, of course, of Microsoft. We didn't really know Satya, and one of the first things he did is he decided to put Office on IOS and Android phones, and that blew us away. I mean, probably not just us in Qualcomm, but the industry.  That was quite a bold move, and so when I got the call from Microsoft they said, \"Well, it's a job reporting to Satya. You'd be running business development.\" I thought, \"I just want to call back to understand what it's about. The company seems to be in this big transition, and I just want to learn a little bit basically.\" But of course was never going to go anywhere. I lived in San Diego there wasn't any question that I was going anywhere. When I called back I was just drawn in, and eventually I had a conversation with Satya.  Shontell: He called you on a Saturday.  Johnson: He did, yeah. He did, and so I was chatting with him, and again it was kind of like another aha moment. He was talking about his world view of a mobile-first, cloud-first world, and all of a sudden it just connected with me because obviously I'd been living in a mobile-first world, a wireless world. That was what I knew inside and out. I felt very comfortable in that world. Then when data left the phone it went off to that thing called the cloud and Qualcomm didn't have much to do with that. As he was talking about this idea of ambient computing and having intelligence everywhere it just clicked with me that this is something I need to know more about, and I wanted to understand more about Satya's vision, and eventually took a trip to Seattle.  I remember getting on the plane in San Diego feeling like, \"I hope nobody sees me because I've never done this before. I'm gonna go visit another company for a job possibly.\" And had a chance to meet the rest of the management team, and then to sit down with Satya. His vision to empower every person and organization on the planet, to achieve more, it just struck me, and it resonated with me, and I ended up saying yes, making the move with my family. We had only one child at home at that time, and so we moved up to Seattle, where I live today.  Shontell: He's done incredible things with Microsoft.  Johnson: He has, absolutely.  Shontell: What's he like to work with?  Johnson: Very empathetic. He's a listener. He's a learner. Curious. We're allowed to fail, learn from it, but it's super important. He's really changed the company at its core, and we are following a growth mindset, which he introduced to the company, and I feel like whenever we sort of get off path a little bit, we come back to the growth mindset. We'll say, \"Are we exhibiting a growth mindset here?\" You know? It's easy to say no. Any idea you can have 10 nos. It's a lot harder to say yes. So the growth mindset allows us to push boarders a little bit, and to say yes more, try things out, fail fast. I believe it's changed the core of the company, and I hear that from others outside, which is very gratifying. But what's so exciting is that the campus is energized, and it's just been a wild, crazy, fun ride for the last three years.  What it takes to be Microsoft's deal-maker-in-chief  As executive vice president for business development, Johnson has overseen more than 40 investments, including the $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith  Shontell: So it's been three years. You've done a lot. One thing that stands out: You worked with a big team on the LinkedIn deal. Microsoft bought LinkedIn for $26 billion-plus.  Johnson: Yeah: $26 billion.  Shontell: So how does a $26 billion deal happen? How long did it take? What happens behind the scenes? Because most of us don't get to that level.  Johnson: It takes an army, for sure. I mean, I would say the evolution of an acquisition that big has to go through many, many gates, and it starts with sort of conversations. It starts with a strategy. \"Are we the better owners?\" Looking at it from all different angles.  Clearly, one of that size needs to be assessed fully, and we have fantastic teams across the company who are so good at that assessment. Also, the engagement, once we decided to make the decision to go forward, the engagement with the company, the integration part, which is super important. You can make all of the great strategic assessments ahead of time, but if you can't integrate well after, you've lost a lot of money. The teams at Microsoft are just first class at that.  Shontell: So is it a 10-month process? Faster?  Johnson: I can't remember. There were conversations for a long period of time, but then once we sort of pulled the trigger, I want to say \u2014 I don't know \u2014 maybe it was somewhere between six and 12 months. I can't quite remember from the time of the first conversations until we announced that we were going to proceed with an acquisition.  Shontell: When I saw the headline, and we were writing it on Business Insider, it was like, \"Oh, whoa. This is a huge deal.\" It went totally under the radar. You didn't get scooped.  Johnson: Another thing that I think we did a very good job on ... because obviously a team that size inside the company did a very good job of keeping things quiet on both sides. Including the transactional folks in between. So all of that had rolled out very, very well. It was sort of the example of how you'd like to do an acquisition.  Shontell: I'm sure you say no, of course, much more than you say yes. One that stands out is Slack, I think, was an opportunity to buy, and I think Microsoft ultimately passed, along with some others. On a deal like that, how do you weigh it?  Johnson: Well, without commenting specifically on Slack, I would say for any acquisition we ask that question, \"Are we the better owners? Does it fulfill a strategic gap that we have?\" Because many times a partnership is even better oftentimes because to be an owner you have to be all in, but if a partnership can work to fill a gap, we'll go that route. Sometimes we'll make an investment in a company because they're on a quicker path to filling a gap, but they may need a little help in the form of resources to get there. Then finally if the right answer is, \"Yes, we are the better owners,\" we'll go the full way and go forward with an acquisition.  So we do sort of an assessment that way, and we try to be very, very disciplined, and stick to our core ambitions, and not go too far off of that, because that's where you get into trouble. So we talk ourselves in and out of things often.  Johnson explains how to be a good leader  Johnson learned a lot of leadership skills growing up in a family with 15 children. Microsoft  Shontell: You've said that prioritization is a skill that you learned really early on. Do you have tips? How do you figure out, in a job as huge as yours \u2014 I'm sure you have a million different things that you could be doing \u2014 how do you focus, and how do you zero in on the right things?  Johnson: Well, I think I learned it from my mom, who is probably the program-manager-in-chief to run a house like that. Because one of the things she used to say is, \"We may have 15 kids, but we're not gonna be a messy house. When people come in the house we don't want them to say, 'Oh yeah, this is what I thought a house with 15 kids would look like.'\" So she was very disciplined. She made lists \u2014 and I love lists \u2014 and checking things off the list always feels good.  So I learned sort of that prioritization from my mom, and that it's not important to get everything on the list done but really to make sure that you set out in the morning to get the top ones done. That's what your focus should be. You shouldn't be stressed that you didn't get to the bottom of the list. She was very good at that.  Shontell: Another skill of yours is you're great, from what I've heard your coworkers say, you're great at building these relationships that last a long time. Especially in that business \u2014 it's so critical to have that. How do you do that? What are your tips for building long-lasting work and general life relationships?  Johnson: I think it goes back to that family table when I was the listener in the room, and that is something that is probably a little bit underrated, but for me has been, I feel like, the core of my leadership abilities is the ability to listen, and to deeply listen, and to understand and put myself in the other person's shoes. Once you do that you can solve whatever problem there is on the table whether it's a business problem or a technical problem, I think, more quickly having that ability to put yourself on the other side.  Shontell: Then I have a kind of more general landscape question. I think someone asked you once what you thought the biggest issue women face in the workforce is, and you said harassment. Certainly we've seen a lot of stories about that this year, Harvey Weinstein on up. What do you think we can do better? How do you think we can fix it? What have you seen that makes you say that?  Johnson: Well, I just feel like you should be able to have a respectful work environment, because if you do you'll be your best self. You'll bring your best self to work, and over the years there was always that whispering at work when there was people you avoided because you didn't want a comment about your dress or something, and I think about all of the cycles that my friends and I would share, you know, \"Don't go by that person's office. Go the long way around.\" Those cycles could have been put to a lot better use. So there's kind of a business reason to stop this, and there's obviously all of the other reasons that we've been talking about since the #MeToo movement started, but there's also a basic business reason. We could be so much more productive if we didn't have to spend all those cycles sort of fending off that sometimes subtle harassment, but it sort of exists there, and if we can together say, \"Let's just have an inclusive, respectful environment at work,\" and teach our boys and our girls, I think we'll be far more productive. We'll be our best selves. We'll bring our best selves to work because we'll know we'll be in a comfortable environment.  Shontell: You've had an incredible career, many years ahead of it still, but the point that you've gotten to is just really inspiring. If you're looking back or you're giving someone advice who's just starting their career, what do you wish you had known then, and what would you advise someone who wants to rise to the top like you have?  Johnson: Well, I think the best advice I ever got was just to be myself, and I think once I settled into who I am, I'm quiet, I'm somewhat introverted, and decided that's OK, it's OK to be who I am. Then my career took off. So for someone starting I would say, \"Be who you are. If you are aggressive and assertive that's fine, too. Just embrace who you are because we really need that diversity of thought at work. We don't need a bunch of Peggy Johnsons of any one type. We really need the sort of the mix and the blend of all the different opinions and voices.\" That I think would be good advice for someone just stepping into their career.  Shontell: Thank you so much, Peggy. It's really been fun.  Johnson: Thank you, Alyson. Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-02", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/peggy-johnson-microsoft-linkedin-interview-2018-2"}, {"article": "A Microsoft logo is seen in Los Angeles Thomson Reuters By Salvador Rodriguez  SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Monday said 200,000 organizations are now using Teams, its year-old workplace collaboration software, up from 125,000 in September, a sign the company may be making some progress in its battle with Slack Technologies Inc.  Microsoft also announced a slate of new features for Teams, including instant language translation.  Slack's emergence as a popular platform for workplace messaging and document-sharing is a threat to Microsoft's long-standing dominance in office productivity software.  Teams now comes bundled with Microsoft Office 365 as the company battles rival offerings from companies including privately-held Slack, Alphabet Inc's Google , Atlassian Corp PLC , Cisco Systems Inc and Facebook Inc .  \"These group messaging tools go far beyond just chat and are becoming a central hub for integrating a variety of business applications into a single user interface,\" said Alan Lepofsky, analyst with Constellation Research. \"They are essentially the new inbox.\"  Microsoft has raced to make Teams a viable competitor after realizing several years ago that Slack was making inroads with big customers. A former Microsoft Office executive told Reuters that learning of the widespread adoption of Slack at Walt Disney Co in early 2015 was an especially important wake-up call.  \"It's one thing when an app gains traction with startups in Silicon Valley, that happens all the time,\" said the former employee, who asked not to be named. \"But it's another when your biggest, longest-tenured customers start adopting it, and then you realize you have to respond.\"  San Francisco-based Slack said in September that it had 6 million daily users and more than 50,000 paying teams. It has not published new figures since then.  Microsoft has not released comparable figures for Teams.  Slack has a big lead when it comes to third-party applications, with more than 1,000 compared to 250 for Teams.  Teams is still not as simple to use as Slack and lacks the depth of functionality, said Wayne Kurtzman, an analyst with the research firm IDC.  \"As great as Microsoft Teams has done in the past year, it's still not as mature of a product,\" Kurtzman said.  Microsoft says it is gaining ground, pointing to customers such as Navistar, the manufacturer of trucks and buses. Navistar moved about a thousand employees onto Teams last year, choosing it over Slack due to its long-time relationship with Microsoft, said Terry Kline, Navistar chief information officer.  \"We looked at Slack, and we didn't see any significant advantage,\" Kline told Reuters in a phone interview.  The move has reduced the company's use of email by 3 percent, he added.  Other Teams customers include Macy's, General Motors, General Electric, ConocoPhillips and Nascar, according to Microsoft.  \"It's surprised all of us how extremely well it's doing,\" Microsoft Teams General Manager Lori Wright told Reuters.

Microsoft has been losing ground to other cloud computing and enterprise software-as-a-service competitors, namely Amazon, but the company could leverage LinkedIn and similarly aggressive acquisitions to kick the unit into high gear, one analyst says.  \"Given that we believe Microsoft feels emboldened with the success of LinkedIn, we think such a renewed focus on SaaS applications could include M&A,\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Keith Bachman said in a note to clients Thursday. \"One area that we think could be a new growth opportunity within the SaaS market is in HCM, or talent management in particular, which would further leverage LinkedIn.\"  Microsoft purchased LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in June 2016.

Microsoft  While Microsoft dominates the global market for classroom PCs, Google Chrome OS rules the roost in the United States.  Microsoft is teaming up with partners including Lenovo to bring a new line of cheap, sub-$300 PCs to market, to take on Google's low-cost Chromebooks.  Microsoft says that a Windows PC is more capable than a Chromebook \u2014 Windows 10 lets you run software like Minecraft or the full version of Microsoft Office.  Minecraft is getting a new chemistry module for students.  Google has all but captured the market for American classrooms \u2014 analyst firm Futuresource estimates that in the third quarter of 2017, Google's low-cost Chromebooks accounted for 59.8% of the laptop market for K-12 education, compared to Microsoft Windows devices' 22.3% share.  But Microsoft would be quick to remind you that this doesn't tell the whole story: That 22.3% share is up from 18.4% the quarter before, and Microsoft says, up 4% from the same period in 2016. And, worldwide, Windows still reigns supreme: In that same third quarter of 2017, Windows accounted for 66.5% of global K-12 classroom PC shipments.  Now, Microsoft is striking back against Google's domestic dominance, with a series of announcements designed to make Windows PCs, Microsoft Office 365, and even the Minecraft video game sensation more appealing for education customers at home and abroad.  Chief among those announcements: New laptops for the classroom, priced between $189 and $299, manufactured by partners Lenovo and JP. These laptops will run Windows 10 S, a version of the operating system streamlined for better battery life and performance \u2014 at the big tradeoff of only being able to install apps from the Microsoft Store.  Microsoft Corporate VP Yusuf Mehdi tells Business Insider that Microsoft is trying to undercut the price advantage of Chromebooks, which often sell for under $299. But because these PCs can run the full versions of Windows software, including Microsoft Office and Minecraft, they offer \"none of the compromises of a Chromebook.\"  Mehdi gives Google credit where he believes credit is due: He says that Chromebooks didn't actually steal any marketshare away from Microsoft, per se; Google just discovered a previously-unmet demand for low-priced laptops and \"made it affordable to have a computer in the classroom.\" And although Apple has had a strong business in schools, but its products are much more expensive.  A new Chemistry Module for Minecraft: Education Edition will let students play around with both atoms and chemical compounds, in the safety of the virtual world. Microsoft  Now, says Mehdi, the burden is on Microsoft to go out and prove that a Windows machine is more capable than a Chromebook of the same price. Many of the low-cost Windows devices announced on Monday will boast touchscreens and stylus support. Some, will even be compatible with certain virtual reality headsets, a feature schools love, Mehdi adds.  Beyond the hardware, Mehdi highlights updates to the software in the Office 365 for Education suite. For instance, the Microsoft Teams chat tool is getting an iOS and Android app for education users. And Minecraft: Education Edition, which is already widely used to teach programming, is getting a chemistry module for students to perform science experiments in the safety of the virtual world.  According to Futuresource, the time could be right for Microsoft, too: Many schools bought their Chromebooks for students in 2014 and 2015, meaning that they could be looking to do a wide-scale replacement in 2018. That's an opportunity for Microsoft to convince them to switch to Windows \u2014 an opportunity he says the company doesn't intend to squander.  \"We finally feel like we have a strong value proposition,\" says Mehdi.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-22", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-windows-10-versus-google-chromebooks-in-classroom-2018-1"}, {"article": "AP  Microsoft is going after Google, Box, and Dropbox customers with a new offer for its OneDrive for Business cloud storage service.  If your business is already using cloud storage from one of those three companies, Microsoft will give you OneDrive for free for the duration of your contract with them.  The fine print: Your company needs to have more than 500 users, and you can't already be a customer of OneDrive or the Office 365 cloud productivity suite.  Google, Box, and Dropbox, be warned: Microsoft is coming for your customers.  On Tuesday, Microsoft announced a new offer to entice companies to use its OneDrive cloud storage service. If you're a business that's already using any of those three competitors, Microsoft will give you its OneDrive for Business service for free until your contract with the other company ends.  The promotional offer comes with some caveats: You have to commit to 500 seats or more, meaning small businesses won't really be able to take advantage. You have to not already be a customer of OneDrive, or of the Microsoft Office 365 productivity suite. And the deal is only good through June 18th.  The big idea is to give customers a taste of what Microsoft can offer, without having to worry about their existing commitments to those other vendors. Microsoft is confident enough that those big customers will sign on, it seems, that they're willing to swallow the cost. In general, Microsoft is seeing solid growth in its subscription cloud businesses, bolstering its confidence here.  As for why customers would want to make the change: Microsoft is touting the deep integrations between its own OneDrive service and Microsoft Office. While Microsoft Office is compatible with cloud storage from those other companies to a certain degree, there are some special features that Microsoft reserves for its own offerings.  For instance, you need OneDrive if you want to have multiple authors simultaneously work on a single Office document in real-time from the computer or smartphone apps. And OneDrive integrates with other Microsoft apps like the team portal SharePoint, so files stay in sync across the suite.  Plus, Microsoft Global Senior Director Seth Patton hypes up the security of OneDrive, saying that it means most customers' most stringent requirements.  \"That's a pretty big deal,\" Patton tells Business Insider.  Still, with this offer, Microsoft might find itself preaching to the choir somewhat. While Box, Dropbox, and Google's G Suite certainly have a certain number of large-enterprise customers, they're mostly known for appealing to smaller and midsize businesses.  Microsoft is already generally considered to be the leader in large companies, given the fact that its Office suite is, and remains, the gold standard in the productivity market. Still, with analysts urging Dropbox to pursue an enterprise-focused strategy ahead of its purported IPO, perhaps Microsoft is just trying to consolidate its lead ahead of time.  After this offer expires, customer will have to pay for OneDrive for Business like usual. Plans start at $5 per user per month, or else you could opt in for a $12.50 per user per month subscription to the Office 365 cloud productivity suite \u2014 at which point you'd get access to all of the Office applications, like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, too.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-06", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-has-a-new-plan-to-steal-google-dropbox-and-box-customers-2018-2"}, {"article": "Getty Images/Stephen Brashear  Microsoft's stock fell on Thursday morning after the company reported modest quarterly earnings.  Investors were concerned they did not see enough accelerated growth, and that profits would not be returned in the form of increased buybacks or dividends.  Watch Microsoft's stock move in real time here.    Shares of Microsoft slipped after the company reported quarterly profits that modestly beat expectations, but failed to enthuse investors.  Microsoft was down 1.45% at $93.63 in pre-market trading on Thursday.  Though Microsoft reported better-than-expected earnings of $0.96 a share on revenue of $28.92 billion, the company was also hit with a one-time charge of $13.8 billion due to the newly-passed tax law.  The \"lack of accelerated capital return\" and the newly guided corporate tax rate below 21% \"may modestly disappoint,\" said RBC Analyst Ross MacMillan. He said that the technology company remains focused on reinvesting in growth rather than returning profits, in the form of a buyback or special dividend, to investors.  Yet revenues from Microsoft's Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Microsoft Office, the Office 365 cloud suite, and LinkedIn, grew 25% year-over-year and its Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its Azure platform, grew 15% during the same period. Revenue from its personal computing segment posted modest growth of 2%.  Still, MacMillan raised his price target to $105, up 12% from its current price.  He believes that Microsoft could see more upside with an acceleration of Azure and LinkedIn services and offerings, the wider adoption of the Azure Stack, Microsoft's hybrid cloud platform, and a markedly improved commercial PC market, as well as improved Windows performance.

Microsoft, No. 17-2, has been closely watched by the technology industry, which sometimes has a testy relationship with the Justice Department.  The dispute arose from a federal drug investigation in which prosecutors sought the emails of a suspect stored in a Microsoft data center in Dublin.

A federal magistrate judge in New York granted the government\u2019s request to issue a warrant for the data under the 1986 federal law, the Stored Communications Act. A federal district judge agreed.  Microsoft challenged the warrant, arguing that prosecutors could not force it to hand over customer emails stored abroad.  A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, ruled that the warrant in the case could not be used to obtain evidence beyond the nation\u2019s borders because the 1986 law did not apply extraterritorially. In a concurring opinion, Judge Gerard E. Lynch said the question was a close one, and he urged Congress to revise the 1986 law, which he said was badly outdated.  Michael R.

She was racist, xenophobic and downright filthy. At one point, she said the Holocaust did not happen. But she was old technology.  Let loose on the internet nearly two years ago, Tay was an experimental system built by Microsoft. She was designed to chat with digital hipsters in breezy, sometimes irreverent lingo, and American netizens quickly realized they could coax her into spewing vile and offensive language. This was largely the result of a simple design flaw \u2014 Tay was programmed to repeat what was said to her \u2014 but the damage was done. Within hours, Microsoft shut her down for good.  Since then, a new breed of conversational technology has emerged inside Microsoft and other internet giants that is far more nimble and effective than the techniques that underpinned Tay. And researchers believe these new systems will improve at an even faster rate when they are let loose on the internet. But sometimes, like Tay, these conversational systems reflect the worst of human nature. And given the history here, companies like Microsoft are reluctant to set them free \u2014 at least for now.  These systems do not simply repeat what is said to them or respond with canned answers. They teach themselves to carry on a conversation by carefully analyzing reams of real human dialogue. At Microsoft, for instance, a new system learns to chat by analyzing thousands of online discussions pulled from services like Twitter and Reddit. When you send this bot a message, it chooses a response after generating dozens of possibilities and ranking each according to how well it mirrors those human conversations.  If you complain about breaking your ankle during a football game, it is nimble enough to give you some sympathy. \u201cOuch, that\u2019s not good,\u201d it might say. \u201cHope your ankle feels better soon.\u201d If you mention house guests or dinner plans, it responds in remarkably precise and familiar ways.  marcy79  conversational_bot  Closest match to human speech Closest match to human speech Lower-ranking potential responses Lower-ranking potential responses  Despite its sophistication, this conversational system can also be nonsensical, impolite and even offensive at times. If you mention your company\u2019s C.E.O., it may assume you are talking about a man \u2014 unaware that women are chief executives, too. If you ask a simple question, you may get a cheeky reply.  marcy79  conversational_bot    Microsoft\u2019s researchers believe they can significantly improve this technology by having it chat with large numbers of people. This would help identify its flaws and generate much sharper conversational data for the system to learn from. \u201cIt is a problem if we can\u2019t get this in front of real users \u2014 and have them tell us what is right and what isn\u2019t,\u201d said a longtime Microsoft researcher, Bill Dolan.  But there lies the conundrum. Because its flaws could spark public complaints \u2014 and bad press \u2014 Microsoft is wary of pushing this technology onto the internet.  The project represents a much wider effort to build a new breed of computing system that is truly conversational. At companies like Facebook, Amazon and Salesforce as well as Microsoft, the hope is that this technology will provide smoother and easier ways of interacting with machines \u2014 easier than a keyboard and mouse, easier than a touch-screen, easier than Siri and other digital assistants now on the market, which are still a long way from fluid conversation.  For years, Silicon Valley companies trumpeted \u201cchatbots\u201d that could help you, say, book your next plane flight or solve a problem with your new computer tablet. But these have never lived up to the billing, providing little more than canned responses to common queries.  Now, thanks to the rise of algorithms that can quickly learn tasks on their own, research in conversational computing is advancing. But the industry as a whole faces the same problem as Microsoft: The new breed of chatbot talks more like a human, but that is not always a good thing.  \u201cIt is more powerful,\u201d said Alex Lebrun, who works on similar conversational systems at Facebook\u2019s artificial intelligence lab in Paris. \u201cBut it is more dangerous.\u201d  The new breed relies on \u201cneural networks,\u201d complex algorithms that can learn tasks by identifying patterns in large pools of data. Over the last five years, these algorithms have accelerated the evolution of systems that can automatically recognize faces and objects, identify commands spoken into smartphones, and translate from one language to another. They are also speeding the development of conversational systems \u2014 though this research is significantly more complex and will take longer to mature.  It may seem surprising that Microsoft researchers are training their conversational system on dialogue from Twitter and Reddit, two social networking services known for vitriolic content. But even on Twitter and Reddit, people are generally civil when they really fall into conversation, and these services are brimming with this kind of dialogue.  Microsoft researchers massage the conversational data they load into the system in small ways, but for the most part, they simply feed the raw dialogues into their neural networks, and these algorithms therefore learn from interactions that are very human. According to Mr. Dolan, in analyzing this data, the system learns to perform well even in the face of poor spelling and grammar. If you type \u201cwinne tonight drink resttaurant,\u201d it might respond with: \u201ci\u2019m not a fan of wine.\u201d It can engage in a real back-and-forth dialogue, asking for everything it needs to, say, connect with you on Linkedin. And for the most part, it behaves with civility.  Top 25 Responses to \u201cwho's Adele?\u201d  When Microsoft\u2019s conversational system receives a message, it generates dozens of possible responses and ranks each according to how well it mirrors human dialogue.

Though these conversational systems are generally civil, they are sometimes rude \u2014 or worse. It is not just that the technology is new and flawed. Because they learn from vast amounts of human conversation, they learn from the mistakes we humans make, and the prejudice we exhibit.  Mr. Lebrun estimated that once in every thousand responses, this new breed of chatbot will say something racist or aggressive or otherwise unwanted. Researchers can fix these problems, but that involves gathering more and better data, or tweaking the algorithms through a process of extreme trial and error.  This is a problem for A.I. services in general. More than two years ago, a software developer noticed that the new Google Photos service was identifying black people as gorillas. Google promptly barred the service from identifying gorillas and similar animals, and it has yet to provide a fix.  But identifying and solving problems with conversational systems is harder, just because the scope of these systems \u2014 general dialogue \u2014 is so large. Image recognition is a single task. Conversation is many tasks, because it bounces back and forth, and each response can affect all the responses to come.  For this reason, Adam Coates, a partner at the venture capital firm Khosla Ventures who previously oversaw the Silicon Valley A.I. lab attached to the Chinese internet giant Baidu, warns that building a truly conversational system is far more difficult than building services that can recognize giraffes, say, or translate between German and French. \u201cThere is a huge technical barrier here. We really don\u2019t know how to build a personal assistant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may not be simply a matter of more data. We may be missing a big idea.\u201d  In the short term, many believe, conversational systems will be most effective if they are limited to particular tasks, like asking for IT help or getting medical advice. That is still a long way from a bot that will respond well to anything you say. But Mr. Dolan believes these systems will continue to evolve over the next few years, provided companies like Microsoft can get them in front of the public.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-21", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/21/technology/conversational-bots.html"}, {"article": "Q.

On Tuesday the Supreme Court will consider if U.S. internet providers can subvert federal law and public safety.  At issue in Microsoft v. U.S. is whether warrants issued under the 1986 Stored Communications Act apply to records stored on the cloud. The law allows the government to obtain records from a U.S. internet provider if there is probable cause of a crime. A special Section 2703 warrant functions like a subpoena since law enforcement doesn\u2019t directly seize records from servers.  In 2013 the U.S. government sought such a warrant for contents associated with an MSN.com email account believed to include evidence of narcotics trafficking. A federal magistrate issued a warrant covering \u201cinformation associated with\u201d the account \u201cstored at premises owned, maintained, controlled, or operated by Microsoft Corporation.\u201d  While Microsoft agreed to disclose records stored on its U.S. servers, it refused to turn over content on its \u201ccloud\u201d servers in Dublin, Ireland. The Redmond, Wash.-based company, which was held in civil contempt, says the law doesn\u2019t authorize extraterritorial warrants. It\u2019s right on this point, but wrong on everything else.  In Morrison (2010) and RJR Nabisco, Inc. (2016), the Supreme Court developed a two-step analysis to determine if a law applies overseas. First, courts must ask whether a law includes a \u201cclear, affirmative indication that [the statutory provision] applies extraterritorially.\u201d If not, the statute is presumed not to be extraterritorial.  But then courts must assess whether a case primarily \u201cinvolves a domestic application of the statute\u201d by looking at its \u201cfocus.\u201d As the Court held in Nabisco, \u201cIf the conduct relevant to the statute\u2019s focus occurred in the United States, then the case involves a permissible domestic application even if other conduct occurred abroad.\u201d  This second part is key in the Microsoft case. There\u2019s no disputing that the Stored Communications Act doesn\u2019t expressly apply to foreign parties. The government could not compel an internet provider based in France to hand over a French citizen\u2019s emails. But as the judge who issued the warrant observed, the government\u2019s application of the law \u201cdoes not criminalize conduct taking place in a foreign country\u201d and doesn\u2019t deploy U.S. cops overseas.  Employees at Microsoft headquarters could obtain records stored on foreign servers with a few keystrokes. Internet providers typically decide where to store data to maximize efficiency. Google cuts up emails into \u201cshards,\u201d which can move between countries within seconds without human intervention. U.S. internet users aren\u2019t entitled to know where in the cloud their records are stored, let alone to recourse under U.S. law if a company moves them.  A federal district judge held that the Microsoft warrant wasn\u2019t extraterritorial since the disclosure of records to the government occurs in the U.S. But a Second Circuit Court of Appeals panel disagreed in 2016, and tech companies have since resisted warrants for data stored overseas. While the circuit refused to hear the case en banc, Judges Jos\u00e9 Cabranes, Dennis Jacobs, Reena Raggi and Christopher Droney wrote an incisive dissent on the far-reaching implications of the panel\u2019s rogue ruling, which conflicts with every other district and magistrate decision.  The panel \u201chas substantially burdened the government\u2019s legitimate law enforcement efforts; created a roadmap for the facilitation of criminal activity; and impeded programs to protect the national security of the United States and its allies,\u201d the judges explained.  Tech firms argue that a Court decision upholding the government\u2019s authority to compel disclosure of data overseas would cause international friction due to conflicting legal regimes on data privacy. But more than a dozen countries including Australia, France, Ireland, Canada and the U.K. assert this authority. The U.S. would be an outlier.  They also argue that Congress is better situated to resolve the complicated issues of cloud computing that were never envisioned three decades ago. Senators Orrin Hatch and Chris Coons have introduced legislation to modernize the Stored Communications Act and clarify legal obligations for internet providers.  But pending legislation shouldn\u2019t obviate a judicial decision on a black-and-white legal question critical to public safety.

MSFT -0.53% is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter earnings after the market closes Wednesday. Here\u2019s what to expect.  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence expect Microsoft to report per-share earnings of 86 cents under generally accepted accounting principles, up from 80 cents a year earlier. Microsoft no longer reports adjusted figures, reflecting accounting changes it adopted at the start of the fiscal year. The year ago figure reflects that change.  REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect Microsoft to post revenue of $28.41 billion, up from $25.83 billion a year earlier. The year-ago figure, too, reflects the new accounting standard.  WHAT TO WATCH:  CLOUDY CONDITIONS: In the last year, Microsoft has emerged as the primary competitor to Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s market-leading cloud-infrastructure business. Three months ago, Microsoft said its commercial-cloud run rate\u2014the last month of sales of its Azure infrastructure services and Office 365 products, multiplied by 12\u2014topped $20 billion, nine months ahead of the company\u2019s target. RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan, in a recent research report, said he expects 85% growth in Azure revenue and 42% growth in the commercial version of Office 365. Mr. MacMillan estimates Microsoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, will climb 10% to $7.4 billion in the quarter, and that its Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office, will grow 24% to $8.9 billion.  PLAYING GAMES: Microsoft\u2019s Xbox videogame console generally does its best business during the holiday quarter, and was primed to do particularly well with the debut of its Xbox One X console in November. Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Brad Reback wrote in a research note that Xbox outsold Sony Corp.\u2019s PlayStation 4 in December, but both were outsold by Nintendo Co.\u2019s Switch. Xbox is part of Microsoft\u2019s More Personal Computing segment, and the console\u2019s gains likely will be offset by continued sluggish PC sales, which track closely to the company\u2019s Windows operating system business. World-wide PC shipments grew 0.7% in the last quarter, according to International Data Corp. Mr. Reback estimates the segment, which is Microsoft\u2019s largest, will grow 0.6% to $11.96 billion.  TAXING TIMES: \u201cTax rate and repatriation commentary from a historically conservative management team represent the key wild card for the quarter,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss wrote in a research report. Mr. Weiss estimates Microsoft\u2019s tax rate will decline to 16% as a result of the tax-code overhaul President Donald Trump signed into law in December. A year ago, Microsoft\u2019s effective tax rate was 18%.  CASH CONSIDERATIONS: Mr. Weiss expects Microsoft to eventually repatriate cash held abroad, which totaled $132.1 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter, behind only Apple Inc.\u2019s $252.3 billion. He didn\u2019t speculate when Microsoft will bring the money to the U.S., but estimates the company will pay about $21 billion in taxes as a result of the tax law, which hits companies with a one-time tax of 15.5% on overseas profits held in cash and other liquid assets. RBC\u2019s Mr. MacMillan wrote about the potential for domestic acquisitions and shareholder returns through dividends or buybacks. Earlier this month, Apple said it would pay $38 billion in taxes as it brings home the vast majority of its overseas cash.

MSFT -0.53% took a $13.8 billion charge related to the new U.S. tax law but reported significant growth in its cloud operations, the business fueling the company\u2019s resurgence.  Microsoft keeps overseas the vast majority of its cash, which rose to $142.8 billion in the quarter. In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood declined to say when the company might bring home some of that money.  Ms. Hood said Microsoft has been \u201cone of the leading returners of capital to shareholders\u201d in recent years, using debt to finance much of that. She said the cash would mitigate the need to turn to debt markets to pay for stock repurchases.  Microsoft already has carved a spot for itself as the No. 2 company behind Amazon.com Inc. in renting computing power and storage over the web. For its fiscal second quarter, the company reported strong gains in the two biggest pieces of its cloud-computing business: its Azure infrastructure services and Office 365 online-productivity business.  Though Microsoft doesn\u2019t disclose revenue for those businesses, it said Azure jumped 98% and Office 365 grew 41%. In the previous quarter, Azure gained 90% and Office 365 grew 42%.  Its Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, climbed 15% to $7.8 billion. Its Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office, gained 25% to $8.95 billion.  Overall, Microsoft posted a loss of $6.3 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with a profit of $6.27 billion, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue grew 12% to $28.92 billion.  Excluding the impact of the tax law, Microsoft reported a profit of $7.5 billion, or 96 cents a share.  Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence expected Microsoft to report per-share earnings of 86 cents on revenue of $28.41 billion.  Shares, which have climbed nearly 50% in the past year to set records, fell a penny to $95 in after-hours trading.  The company\u2019s adjusted tax rate, which doesn\u2019t count the big charge, was 18%, up slightly from a year ago. Looking ahead, Ms. Hood said it expects a 16% tax rate for the second half of the fiscal year, plus or minus 2 percentage points. For fiscal 2019, the company expects the tax rate to be slightly below the new U.S. corporate rate of 21%.  Microsoft rose to its former tech dominance on the strength of Windows, its PC operating system. And while the More Personal Computing segment that includes Windows is Microsoft\u2019s largest, it is also the company\u2019s slowest growing.  That is in part because growth in world-wide PC sales remains sluggish, inching up only 0.7% in the last quarter, according to International Data Corp. More Personal Computing, though, gained 2% to $12.17 billion in the latest period.  In a conference call with Wall Street analysts, Chief Executive Satya Nadella said investments in security technology helped Microsoft quickly address the recent threats from the Spectre and Meltdown processor vulnerabilities.  \u201cOur investments to make Windows 10 the most secure, always up-to-date operating system enabled us to move quickly to protect customers in the face of these threats,\u201d Mr. Nadella said.  The More Personal Computing segment also includes Microsoft\u2019s Xbox videogame business. The holiday quarter is particularly important for gaming at Microsoft, even more so after the company released its new Xbox One X console in November. In the period, gaming revenue\u2014which includes sales of the Xbox console, Xbox Live subscriptions and transactions, and game and accessory sales\u2014rose 8%.

The company says it shouldn\u2019t have to hand over emails stored on a server in Ireland. Photo: NIALL CARSON/PRESS ASSOCIATION/GETTY IMAGES  WASHINGTON\u2014Technology companies will square off with law enforcement on Tuesday as the Supreme Court hears arguments on whether emails and other customer data stored overseas are subject to U.S. search warrants.  The case is one of several legal battles on law-enforcement access to private online data, and it requires the justices to interpret a law that Congress wrote before email and cloud computing were part of everyday life.  A federal appeals court, in a 2016 case involving Microsoft Corp. , handed a blow to prosecutors by ruling that such warrants can\u2019t be enforced on U.S. providers if the data is stored exclusively on foreign servers. That is the decision the Supreme Court is reviewing.  The case highlights broader tensions between tech titans, which view protecting user privacy as a priority, and authorities who believe privacy concerns should take a back seat to public safety in certain circumstances.  Battle lines have been firmly drawn, with opposing camps warning of serious harm if the court rules against their position.  The Justice Department and state attorneys general say the lower court ruling has hampered investigations into an array of crimes, from narcotics trafficking to arson to child pornography. Emails and electronic evidence are now critical to virtually every criminal investigation, they say.  Microsoft, Google and other technology companies say the Justice Department\u2019s position would leave them stuck between U.S. law enforcement and their obligation to abide by privacy laws in foreign jurisdictions. The companies also say the case could threaten American dominance in the $250 billion cloud-computing industry, because foreign clients won\u2019t use U.S. firms if their data isn\u2019t protected.  Foreign governments also have weighed in, urging the Supreme Court not to interpret U.S. law in a way that intrudes on their sovereignty.  \u201cThis may be a case in which the Supreme Court has no truly satisfying outcome available to it, in part because it is being asked to interpret a 1986 law that is not a good fit for the kind of large-scale, cross-border data-storage practices of today,\u201d said David Newman, a lawyer with Morrison & Foerster LLP who closely follows privacy and data-security issues.  The law at issue is the Stored Communications Act, passed by Congress more than 30 years ago to provide privacy protections for electronic records.  The Justice Department applied for a warrant requiring Microsoft to turn over email information from an account allegedly tied to illegal drug activity in the U.S. A magistrate judge issued the warrant after finding the government had established probable cause that the account was connected to narcotics trafficking.  Newsletter Sign-up  Microsoft handed over some account data that was stored in the U.S. but said it shouldn\u2019t have to hand over the emails, which were stored on a server in Ireland. The company said the government has never suggested that the account holder is a citizen or resident of the U.S.  The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Microsoft, ruling the 1986 law didn\u2019t apply beyond U.S. territory.  Microsoft said in its Supreme Court brief that the materials targeted for government seizure are covered by Irish and European Union law. That means the U.S. is seeking to assert the 1986 law beyond domestic borders, which isn\u2019t allowed, the company argued.  Microsoft conceded that U.S. law is outdated but said that was an issue for lawmakers, not judges, to address.  \u201cOnly Congress has the authority and tools to rewrite the statute to strike a new, 21st-Century balance between law-enforcement interests, our relations with foreign nations, the privacy of our citizens, and the competitiveness of our technology industry,\u201d the company said in its brief.  A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced legislation to tackle cross-border data issues, but it isn\u2019t clear if the bill will advance in Congress.  The Justice Department said it isn\u2019t seeking to apply the current U.S. law extraterritorially. It noted the government sought disclosure in the U.S., where officials at Microsoft\u2019s headquarters in Redmond, Wash., have ready access to files stored abroad.  \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s employees could prepare that disclosure without leaving their desks in the United States,\u201d Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote in a court brief.  The department argued that Microsoft\u2019s position could keep investigators from accessing emails and other files even if the subject of the investigation is based in the U.S., if a company chooses to store the consumer\u2019s files overseas.  There is a diplomatic process, governed by legal assistance treaties, that allows the U.S. to request that foreign law-enforcement counterparts share sought-after data, but it can be slow and ineffective, the department said.  WSJ's Joanna Stern \"bumps\" into Peggy Johnson in the elevator at D.Live and asks about Microsoft's next big investments, Solitaire and women in technology. Photo: Andria Chamberlin for The Wall Street Journal  While the case before the court involves Microsoft, the government also took aim at Google, whose network-management practices often involve dividing data from a single customer file into chunks that are moved within an international network of data centers.  If Microsoft\u2019s arguments prevail, then Google\u2019s practices would make its data inaccessible to law enforcement, the Justice Department said.  Google has been involved in several warrant battles with federal and state authorities, agreeing to be held in contempt in some cases for failing to turn over data. The company, like Microsoft, is pushing for a legislative solution.  Since the Second Circuit ruling, legal battles between prosecutors and tech companies have continued in other jurisdictions, and several courts have ruled in the government\u2019s favor, including in California, Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.  A Supreme Court decision is expected by the end of June.

In the same period, the More Personal Computing unit, which includes Windows, gained 2% to $12.17 billion.  \u201cHaving a deep sense of customers\u2019 unmet and unarticulated needs must drive our innovation,\u201d Mr. Nadella said in the email he sent to employees Thursday morning. \u201cWe can\u2019t let any organizational boundaries get in the way of innovation for our customers. This is why a growth-mindset culture matters.\u201d  Microsoft declined to make executives available for comment.  In a post on Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn page, Mr. Myerson, who has run the Windows business since 2013, said the day was an \u201cemotional\u201d one for him but expressed his \u201congoing enthusiasm for Microsoft.\u201d  For most of its 43 years, Microsoft and Windows have been nearly synonymous. Under Mr. Nadella\u2019s predecessor, Steve Ballmer, products were sometimes stalled, or even killed, because they didn\u2019t help expand the market for the operating system.  That Mr. Nadella is willing to shift the company\u2019s focus away from Windows illustrates the irreversible migration from personal computing to mobile devices and the web. It also shows how Mr. Nadella is putting his own imprint on the tech giant.  \u201cHe\u2019s clearly not handcuffed by history,\u201d said Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Brad Reback.  Mr. Nadella is able to break from the past because, during his four years as chief executive, Microsoft has emerged as a leader in cloud computing. Its Azure operations is No. 2 behind Amazon.com in the cloud-infrastructure market. And its Office 365 productivity apps and its Dynamics business-software services are rapidly growing, multibillion-dollar businesses.  \u201cThe Microsoft of old could never have made this move,\u201d Mr. Reback said. \u201cBut the pieces were not in place to make the move.\u201d  Mr. Myerson, a 21-year Microsoft veteran, will leave the company and help with the transition \u201cover the coming months,\u201d Mr. Nadella wrote.  \ufeff The company is breaking Windows in pieces. The platform technology, on which Microsoft\u2019s partners build their own devices, apps and services, will now fall under Scott Guthrie, who runs the Azure business. Mr. Guthrie\u2019s unit, called Cloud + AI Platform, will also include the company\u2019s mixed-reality business, including Microsoft\u2019s Hololens device, as well as its artificial-intelligence business.  Microsoft\u2019s devices business, including its Surface lineup of computers, will fall to Rajesh Jha, who has been in charge of Microsoft\u2019s Office group. The new, bigger unit, called Experiences & Devices, will also include Microsoft\u2019s efforts to develop new features in Windows.  In his note, Mr. Nadella called the future of Windows \u201cbright,\u201d as the company pushes to develop features that take advantage of new types of devices and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. Nearly 700 million devices run Windows 10, the software\u2019s latest version. All told, some version of Windows is on more than 1.5 billion devices world-wide. In the most recent quarter, the More Personal Computing unit accounted for 42% of Microsoft\u2019s revenue.  \u201cThis is the most sweeping reorg that I can recall,\u201d said Brad Silverberg, who ran the Windows division when Microsoft launched its seminal Windows 95 operating system.  In the 1990s, Windows was so dominant that a federal judge ruled that it was a monopoly. The U.S. Department of Justice sought to break up Microsoft, accusing the company of abusing its dominance in the PC operating system market to crush rivals. The company ultimately signed a consent decree in 2002, agreeing, in part, to make Windows interoperable with non-Microsoft software.  While Microsoft is still focused on building the platform upon which other tech companies run their technology, that focus is now on Azure, said Mr. Silverberg, a venture capitalist who co-founded Fuel Capital, a San Francisco-based firm. He praised Mr. Nadella\u2019s acknowledgment of Windows\u2019 reduced importance.  \u201cHe recognizes the world for what it is, not what it used to be,\u201d Mr. Silverberg said.

Alphabet, the parent company of search-engine giant Google, became the second publicly traded U.S. company ever to reach a market value of $800 billion Monday, joining iPhone maker Apple. Alphabet\u2019s Class A shares rose 1.8% to $1,164.00.  Meantime, Microsoft was on track Monday to become the third public U.S. company ever to close with a market value of $700 billion, joining Apple and Alphabet. Shares rose as much as 1.4% to $91.23 and were recently up 1.2%. On Jan. 16, Microsoft briefly touched $700 billion before falling back below that level.  Alphabet has already added about $74 billion in market capitalization this year as of midday Monday, while Microsoft is up about $43 billion, a combined total of $117 billion in added market value for the two tech giants since the start of 2018.  Apple crossed the $700 billion threshold in February 2015 and passed $800 billion and $900 billion last year. It hit that last milestone shortly after Alphabet hit $700 billion.  Monday\u2019s fresh highs are the latest major markers hit by U.S. internet giants in the past year. Investors have flocked to the largest technology firms for their ability to grow revenue despite mixed economic data. Some analysts have said they expect recent gains and lofty valuations in the S&P 500 information technology sector\u2014which is up 42% in the past year\u2014have left the grouping vulnerable to a pullback, but technology stocks have still been among the best performers at the start of 2018.  On Jan. 8, e-commerce firm Amazon.com crossed $600 billion for the first time.  Microsoft\u2019s recent rise has come as the software giant continues to prioritize cloud computing. Microsoft\u2019s next earnings report is expected at the end of the month.  Alphabet has surged over the past year as advertisers spend more and more money on its platforms. Google and Facebook controlled nearly two-thirds of total digital ad spending last year, according to eMarketer, and Alphabet has taken another leg higher in the first days of 2018 as Facebook shares have stumbled on speculation that the retooling of its platform will hurt its advertising revenue.  Although some analysts have said they expect investors to begin to move money out of the tech sector, few think technology stocks are anywhere close to the froth from the dot-com bubble. Microsoft\u2019s recent climb to $600 billion, a mark it also hit in the late 1990s before falling, took much longer than its first ascent.  It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what the next technology market-cap milestone will be. Some had speculated that Apple could climb to $1 trillion, but the iPhone maker has fallen back around$900 billion instead amid doubts about the success of its latest products.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-22", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/01/22/more-milestones-alphabet-hits-800-billion-microsoft-clears-700-billion/"}, {"article": "The Pretty One  In most ways, Dell\u2019s XPS 13 is every bit as good as any of its competitors. In one way it\u2019s the best: By nearly eliminating the bezel around the display, Dell squeezed the XPS 13 into a smaller body than all of its competitors. Without those big borders, the screen just looks better. The XPS 13 scored the second-best time in my battery tests, it has all the right chips and features, and it looks like it cost good money.  But\u2026 that tiny bezel forced Dell to move the webcam down below the screen, which is a terrible place. Rather than framing my face, the camera stares up my nose. (Dell says most users don\u2019t mind the placement.)  The bigger problem is that the XPS 13 you want costs $1,200. The standard model comes with a paltry four gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage\u2014neither of which will suffice.  Microsoft | Surface Pro $958 Battery Looks Power  Versatility  PROS  CONS  Hard to use on your lap; low-end processor  Light, thin and versatile; most tablet-like of the bunch  The Portable One  Like the best camera, the best laptop is the one you have with you. No Windows computer combines portability and functionality quite like Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Surface Pro, the tablet/laptop hybrid that inspired so many competitors. It\u2019s the size and shape of an iPad, with the full power of Windows.  Unfortunately, all that versatility compromises the Surface Pro\u2019s utility, and I don\u2019t just mean the smaller screen. And, because the crucial keyboard accessory sells separately for $160, it\u2019s deceptively expensive. (I\u2019ve included it in my pricing, because you need it.) The only way to hit the $1,000 target and still get the whole kit is to buy the cheapest model, which uses a vastly underpowered processor. You might opt for Microsoft\u2019s other offering in this range, the Surface Laptop but, as comfortable as it is to use, it doesn\u2019t measure up to my other picks.  | Swift 3 Acer $999 Battery Looks Power  Versatility  PROS  CONS  Big and heavy; more desktop than laptop  Lots of ports; big screen and roomy keyboard  The Powerful One  Many laptops in this price range offer enough processing oomph for web browsing, Netflixing and Exceling, but not gamer-grade horsepower. Acer Inc.\u2019s Swift 3 does a little better. Its Core i7 processor, more powerful than you\u2019ll often find at this price, makes the machine more suitable for Photoshop users or inveterate tab-hoarders. Just don\u2019t expect it to run \u201cFortnite.\u201d  Acer also added a large selection of ports to the Swift 3 and a relatively large 14-inch display. But all that extra stuff makes it larger and heavier than my other picks. It works as a stashable in-home family PC, but by today\u2019s standards, it isn\u2019t especially mobile.  Lenovo | Yoga 720 $989 Battery Looks Power  Versatility  PROS  CONS  Shallow keyboard; subpar speakers  Light and flexible; often cheapest of the bunch  The Affordable One  Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s Yoga 720 has almost everything you\u2019d want in a laptop, and I\u2019ve seen it on sale for as little as $750. Its screen back flips to lie flat against the keyboard so you can hold it like a tablet. It\u2019s fast enough, lasts long enough and looks good enough.  My issues with the Yoga individually feel minor: The speakers sound mushy, the keyboard is a bit shallow, the design is bland. Together, they make clear why the 720 is cheaper than the others: It\u2019s a good computer for the price, but if you spend more on something else, you\u2019ll be glad.  HP | Spectre x360 $999 Battery Looks Power  Versatility  PROS  CONS  Gets dirty easily; uneven keyboard backlight  Clean, attractive look; excellent keyboard  The Best One  If all you want is to stop reading and just buy a new computer, here\u2019s your answer: The best $1,000 Windows computer is HP\u2019s latest Spectre x360, a machine that does everything well. We\u2019ve been recommending this line for a few years now, and HP just keeps improving it.  The x360 checks all the spec boxes, looks as good as anything out of Cupertino, Calif., and is enjoyable to use, from the speakers to the keyboard. It has a 360-degree hinge that flips the laptop into a tablet for drawing or using in a cramped space. It uses new USB-C ports for charging and data, but also offers an older-style standard USB-A port.  In my testing, the x360\u2019s biggest problem has been the lid\u2019s tendency to scuff in my bag. It came in third on my super-harsh battery test, behind the Surface Pro and nearly in line with the Dell: You should have no trouble using it through a workday. It\u2019s not rich with new ideas about what computers can be, but when you have work to do, that isn\u2019t the priority. You just want a laptop, and HP made a terrific one.

Shares fell as much as 5% in after-hours trading Wednesday before rebounding. Link:  Microsoft\u2014Down 0.2%: Microsoft said it recorded a $13.8 billion charge related to changes to U.S. tax law that drove the software company into a quarterly loss but posted big fiscal second-quarter gains in its cloud-computing business.  AT&T\u2014Up 3.2%: AT&T expects to keep an extra $20.42 billion in cash for 2018 thanks to new federal tax cuts, a windfall the telecom giant said it plans to spend on network enhancements.

PayPal Holdings Inc.\u2014Down 6.5%: News hit that PayPal will lose a chunk of its business from eBay, as the online marketplace said it would start managing the payments flow of buyers and sellers transacting on its website. PayPal also said fourth-quarter profit rose 59% despite the mobile payments company booking a big charge related to the U.S. tax overhaul.  EBay\u2014Up 11%: EBay also reported earnings and revenue that met Wall Street expectations, as sales rose 9% in the fourth quarter. The company\u2019s 2018 projections topped estimates.

AMZN -1.22%  The search-engine operator has plans to build three new underwater fiber-optic cables lining ocean areas from the Pacific to the North Sea, extending its private data network to regions competitors haven\u2019t touched with similar projects.  The cables, expected to be finished in 2019, are designed to speed the transfer of data and reroute users to servers around the globe if a region fails or gets overloaded.  Google said the investments could cost hundreds of millions of dollars but are worth the expense to get a better shot at the multibillion-dollar cloud-computing market.  \u201cI would prefer not to have to be in the cable-building consortium business,\u201d said Ben Treynor, vice president of Google\u2019s cloud platform, but when the company looked at ways to push its cloud business past new frontiers like Australia and South America, \u201cthere weren\u2019t a lot of great options.\u201d  Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% owns a massive network of fiber-optic cables and data centers built up over the past decade. Mr. Treynor said the infrastructure already adds up to the world\u2019s biggest private network, handling roughly 25% of the world\u2019s internet traffic, and helps Google control its data-intensive software without relying on telecom companies.  The projects would bring the number of subsea cables Google has helped build to 11 after a decade of nonstop construction. Its engineers rely on all those conduits to refresh search results, move video files and serve cloud-computing customers who do business in different parts of the globe.  That last business line could use a boost. Google is third in cloud-computing revenue behind Amazon and Microsoft in the race to win big customers, which run everything from shopping websites to government databases on the tech giants\u2019 computer servers. Billions of dollars of annual revenue are at stake as corporations move their information-technology operations to more flexible systems on the cloud.  Google has teamed up with other firms, including domestic telephone operators and Facebook Inc., to build its subsea cables. But it is breaking precedent with its longest, fully private long-distance cable, which will stretch 6,200 miles from Los Angeles to Chile, where the company finished a data center in 2015.  \u201cThis is, I believe, the largest single pipe into Chile,\u201d Mr. Treynor said of the Curie cable, named after the French scientist Marie Curie.  Related Video \u200bGoogle handles 90% of the world's internet searches, and it increasingly is promoting a single answer for many questions. Even subjective or unanswerable queries sometimes get seemingly definitive answers. Here's how the algorithms are -- and aren't -- working. Video/Photo Illustration: Heather Seidel/The Wall Street Journal  The company is planning to share capacity with Facebook on a planned 4,500-mile cable from the East Coast of the U.S. to Denmark, with a pit stop in Ireland. The Havfrue line, Danish for \u201cmermaid,\u201d will give the company more bandwidth across the Atlantic Ocean.  A planned 2,400-mile cable called HK-G, running from Hong Kong to Guam, will hook up with other cable systems linking Australia, East Asia and North America.  Google\u2019s new cables will help link five new regions for cloud customers in Montreal, the Netherlands, Los Angeles, Finland and Hong Kong.  The company\u2019s network-driven strategy has gained it some attention. PayPal Inc. technology chief Sri Shivananda said the company spent months considering where to move some of its developer and testing systems before settling on Google in mid-2017.  Mr. Shivananda said the payments processor was impressed by Google\u2019s consistently fast connections. Transactions that take too long often make users abandon a purchase entirely, he said.  Some of PayPal\u2019s acquired companies, including Braintree and Venmo, still run partly on Amazon. \u201cWe\u2019ll be a multi-cloud environment\u201d for the foreseeable future, Mr. Shivananda said.  \u2014Jack Nicas contributed to this article.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-16", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-plans-to-expand-huge-undersea-cables-to-boost-cloud-business-1516098601"}, {"article": "What\u2019s more, more than half of members, 51%, used LinkedIn every few weeks or less often, Pew found. By comparison, 76% of Facebook Inc. members used the service at least daily, Pew found.  At the time of the deal, Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said one goal was to weave together the tools people use to get their jobs done and professional networks that connect workers.  To achieve that end, LinkedIn needs members such as Mr. Frank to engage more frequently, updating their job titles, contacts, career achievements and more\u2014data crucial to Microsoft\u2019s plans to integrate its expensive acquisition. Microsoft wants to pump that data into artificial-intelligence offerings, business-software services and even its Office productivity tools, such as its Outlook email and calendar programs.  Artificial intelligence could help Microsoft\u2019s Dynamics business play catch-up to Salesforce.com Inc. To that end, Microsoft is using LinkedIn data to help sales representatives target fertile prospects, critical in the so-called customer-relationship management market that Gartner Inc. estimates hit $39.4 billion last year.  Microsoft has started to infuse Office apps with LinkedIn data about contacts, so meeting attendees learn about one another directly from calendar invitations. The company hopes that level of integration will give its venerable franchise a leg up against Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Gmail.  Applying artificial-intelligence algorithms to LinkedIn data could create new revenue opportunities for Microsoft, said Goldman Sachs & Co. analyst Heather Bellini. \u201cThis is a company that has different ways to monetize than it used to,\u201d she said.  LinkedIn is about to roll out a passel of features aimed at drawing people regularly. For the past year, its engineers have worked on Project Agora, revamping everything from the site\u2019s news feed to the service that lets members message one another.  This spring, LinkedIn will add an \u201cinterest panel\u201d to members\u2019 home pages that will include groups they\u2019ve joined and hashtags they\u2019ve followed\u2014features intended to keep members coming back to learn the latest on topics that matter to them. By summer, LinkedIn will add content from groups into news feeds and notify members of such posts. That way, members will see posts that are related to their interests and won\u2019t be put off by posts from connections with whom they have little in common.  Still, it is a steep challenge to get members to carve out more time for the service, particularly if they turn to LinkedIn only when looking for work or seeking out sales leads, said TJ Keitt, a senior analyst at Forrester Research Inc.  \u201cThere are a ton of people that don\u2019t have an immediate need to engage with it,\u201d Mr. Keitt said.

Mr. Prasad recognizes the challenge of changing people\u2019s perceptions of LinkedIn as just a place to look for new job opportunities. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re under an illusion that it\u2019s going to happen on day one,\u201d he said.

Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images  WASHINGTON\u2014Supreme Court justices voiced concern Tuesday that Microsoft Corp.\u2019s MSFT -0.53% resistance to U.S. search warrants for customer emails stored overseas would hamper criminal investigations, in a case that pits leading tech companies against law enforcement.  During an hourlong oral argument, the court considered whether email providers like Microsoft, Yahoo and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL -0.12% Google have to comply with warrants if the government is seeking email messages and other digital files that are stored on computer servers outside the U.S.  Several justices said it wasn\u2019t ideal that the case was controlled by a 1986 federal law on electronic records that Congress adopted before email and cloud-computing were part of the social fabric. Still, the court appeared to be searching for a way to interpret the outdated law that wouldn\u2019t rob the government of tools to investigate crimes with a digital trail that crossed U.S. borders.  \u201cThis is what troubles me,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito said. \u201cIt would be good if Congress enacted legislation that modernized this. But in the interim, something has to be done.\u201d  The justices were reviewing a lower-court ruling Microsoft won in 2016 that clipped the Justice Department\u2019s authority to obtain overseas emails. The battle dates back to 2013 when the U.S. got a warrant that ordered Microsoft to hand over messages in an email account that was linked to narcotics trafficking. Microsoft argued the warrant wasn\u2019t valid because the emails were stored in Ireland.  Microsoft lawyer Joshua Rosenkranz argued the 1986 law, called the Stored Communications Act, didn\u2019t allow the U.S. government \u201cto unilaterally reach into a foreign land to search for, copy, and import private customer correspondence\u201d that is stored on a foreign computer and protected by foreign law.  Chief Justice John Roberts, however, said Microsoft was a U.S.-based company and had control over where it chose to store emails and other consumer data.  Newsletter Sign-up  \u201cIt\u2019s not the government\u2019s fault that it\u2019s located overseas,\u201d the chief justice said. He added that if Microsoft prevailed, nothing would prevent the company from moving the emails of U.S. customers to overseas servers to protect their data from disclosure.  \u201cYou might gain customers if you can assure them, no matter what happens, the government won\u2019t be able to get access to their emails,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said.  Mr. Rosenkranz said such a scenario \u201cwould never happen\u201d because Microsoft relies upon U.S. facilities to provide the best and fastest service to 200 million domestic customers. People who are intent on hiding their correspondence from the government \u201cdon\u2019t use Microsoft\u2019s services,\u201d he said.  Mr. Rosenkranz also warned the court that a win for the government could do serious harm to the U.S. tech sector. \u201cIf you try to tinker with this without the tools that only Congress has, you are as likely to break the cloud as you are to fix it,\u201d he said.  Google, which has waged similar battles with the government, and an array of other leading tech companies are supporting Microsoft in the case.  Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested the wait-for-Congress approach had some appeal.  \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wiser just to say, \u2018Let\u2019s leave things as they are\u2014if Congress wants to regulate in this brave new world, it should do it\u2019?\u201d Justice Ginsburg asked.  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), who attended the oral argument, recently proposed bipartisan legislation to update the law and give law enforcement access to overseas customer data, while also providing protections for email and cloud computing providers. It isn\u2019t clear if, or when, lawmakers may move forward on such a bill.  No justice during Monday\u2019s session clearly embraced Microsoft\u2019s reading of the 1986 law. Nor did the justices echo concerns about customer privacy that have been voiced by the tech industry.  The government noted that investigators would still have to get a warrant to see the emails.  \u201cIt\u2019s not a case about privacy,\u201d Justice Department lawyer Michael Dreeben told the court. \u201cThe government has the gold standard of an instrument to address privacy interests here\u2014a probable-cause-based warrant issued by a judge that describes with particularity what we want.\u201d  Mr. Dreeben said the lower-court ruling in Microsoft\u2019s favor \u201chas caused grave and immediate harm to the government\u2019s ability to enforce federal criminal law.\u201d  A decision is expected by the end of June.

It didn\u2019t last.  Epic said it turned off \u201ccross-play\u201d once it discovered the error, the latest roadblock to a dream feature for gamers that is technologically possible but frustratingly elusive.  The major console makers\u2014Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo Co. \u2014have long supported cross-play between their machines and personal computers, and more recently with mobile devices.  But the three don\u2019t always play well together, creating headaches for friends who own different consoles and game developers who say the block limits the potential to expand their audiences.  Players of \u2018Fortnite,\u2019 by Epic Games, have been vocal about requesting a cross-play feature.

Recently, the friends agreed not to buy a new Capcom Co. game, \u201cMonster Hunter: World,\u201d for their consoles. Instead, they are waiting for it to come out for PCs in the fall so they can play together, Mr. Ross said.  People playing the same game on different hardware can link up online, provided the developer has built software to allow the two systems to talk to each other. But the developer would still need each hardware makers\u2019 blessing.  At around 2 a.m. ET Thursday, more than 600,000 people tuned into Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Twitch live-streaming platform to watch rapper Drake play \u201cFortnite\u201d on a PlayStation 4 with a popular streamer who was using a PC. The live stream, which handily beat the previous Twitch record for simultaneous viewers on the channel of an individual broadcaster, occurred days after Epic said it would enable both PlayStation 4 and Xbox users to play against people on PCs and mobile devices\u2014though not against each other.  Epic\u2019s announcement prompted a \u201cFortnite\u201d player on Twitter to implore Phil Spencer, Microsoft\u2019s head of games, to add cross-play with Sony\u2019s console. \u201cWe really want cross-play system between XB1 and PS4,\u201d the tweeter said.  \u201cMe 2,\u201d Mr. Spencer tweeted back minutes later.

Sony declined to comment.  It isn\u2019t the first time Sony has been accused of standing in the way. Last year, Psyonix Inc. sought to make its car-soccer game \u201cRocket League\u201d playable across consoles. Microsoft and Nintendo signed up. Sony demurred.  \u201cIt\u2019s extremely frustrating,\u201d Psyonix Chief Executive Dave Hagewood said.  Game developers have good reason to want cross-play, Benchmark Co. analyst Mike Hickey said. \u201cYou\u2019re less likely to go play another game if your buddies are all playing together,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re more engaged, you\u2019re more likely to spend money\u201d on virtual goodies inside the game, he said.  Prohibiting cross-play can be advantageous for a console maker: Shoppers might be inclined to choose the system that friends own, said Piper Jaffray analyst Mike Olson. That tips the scales in favor of the market leader, which right now is Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4.  Microsoft hasn\u2019t always supported cross-play. In 2011, when its Xbox Live service dominated online console games, a company representative told the website Kotaku that Microsoft wasn\u2019t on board, because it couldn\u2019t guarantee players on competing systems would get the same level of quality as on Xbox 360.

The case, set to be heard next month, stems from a dispute between the Justice Department and Microsoft Corp. over access to emails stored on a server in Ireland. Industry officials say it highlights the stark differences between the U.S. and Europe over views on online privacy and the extent of government access to users\u2019 data.  The U.S. government in 2013 obtained a search warrant requiring Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft to hand over email information as part of an investigation into a customer who allegedly was using the account to conduct criminal drug activity.  Microsoft complied with part of the order but rebuffed the request to turn over the email messages, which were stored abroad, arguing that U.S. search warrants don\u2019t reach data stored outside domestic borders. Microsoft argues that complying with the warrant would have meant the company could have run afoul of EU privacy rules.  At issue in the court case are broader questions about who should govern global internet companies, and how. In particular, cloud computing companies, such as Microsoft or Amazon.com Inc., can move data among different servers around the world.  Microsoft says it stores users\u2019 data in the region where a user resides and customers should be in control of their data.  The U.S. argues that its warrant required Microsoft to hand over the information because it can be accessed in the U.S. with the click of a computer mouse, and lack of access to that data could pose significant barriers to ongoing investigations.  \u201cHundreds if not thousands of investigations of crimes\u2014ranging from terrorism, to child pornography, to fraud\u2014are being or will be hampered by the government\u2019s inability to obtain electronic evidence,\u201d the Justice Department said in a court brief.  A U.S. government win in the case could hand U.S. companies operating in Europe an expensive dilemma: either comply with U.S. data requests or risk breaching EU data privacy rules. European companies with business operations in the U.S. also fear they could receive similar requests from American authorities sent to their headquarters abroad.  \u201cThis untenable position would throw a wrench into the countless routine business arrangements that comprise today\u2019s highly interdependent commercial world,\u201d the largest trade organizations from Germany, Ireland, Poland and France said in a joint filing to the court.  Foreign governments can access evidence in Europe for criminal investigations, but the preferred method under EU law is to go directly through member states, as part of what is known as a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty. That approach will be enshrined in the bloc\u2019s new data protection regulation, to enter into force in May. The new rules threaten fines as high as 4% of a firm\u2019s global revenue for failure to comply.  Washington\u2019s position seems to fly in the face of EU sovereignty, some European officials and legal experts said.  \u201cThis can clearly escalate to being a conflict of law and international relations,\u201d said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a Green Party member of the European Parliament and staunch privacy advocate. \u201cThe question [is] if the EU can expect that their own laws apply to their own territory and market or is the U.S. trying to put that into question?\u201d  Companies, governments and institutions in Europe and elsewhere have submitted third-party briefs to the court ahead of the hearing, which is set for February 27. A decision is expected by June.  The U.K., one of the U.S.\u2019s closest law-enforcement allies in Europe, has thrown its weight behind Washington\u2019s arguments in the case. Britain, which is preparing to exit the EU, is also currently negotiating a bilateral treaty with the U.S. over access for law-enforcement purposes to electronic communications held on servers in each other\u2019s jurisdictions.  The case is reminding some Europeans of leaks by one-time National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosing that U.S. tech companies cooperated with the NSA, allowing authorities to access information through a so-called backdoor. Those revelations sowed deep mistrust in Europe of U.S. intelligence practices, straining trans-Atlantic ties and hindering cooperation between Washington and Brussels in other areas.  U.S. tech companies also came under scrutiny from the broader public following the revelations. That is one reason Microsoft is fighting so hard: to maintain its reputation. Microsoft says it has only provided data to the U.S. government under valid legal orders.  \u201cPre-Snowden, this would have been done quietly, there would have been an accommodation\u201d between Microsoft and the government, said James A. Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cEveryone would have gone away happy.\u201d  Now, \u201cthey need to show the world, their global customer base, that they\u2019re not just going to roll over every time the U.S. government asks them for something,\u201d he said.

But the measure drew widespread criticism from privacy and human-rights activists, who suggested U.S. tech companies\u2014under pressure in Washington\u2014had retreated on the issue. They also suggested the bill could leave data stored in the U.S. vulnerable to demands by authoritarian foreign governments.  The measure, known as the Cloud Act, would create a legal framework for resolving the frequent conflicts that have sprung up recently over the issue.  It would amend U.S. law to make clear that law-enforcement warrants can apply to data that U.S.-based tech companies store anywhere in the world. But the act also would give companies a right to challenge warrants in court based on privacy laws in the specific country where the data are stored.  It also would allow for bilateral agreements between the U.S. and other countries over how to deal with disputes in the future, including other countries\u2019 requests for data in the U.S.  The issue has come up more frequently in recent years, as big U.S. tech companies have stored more data overseas. One problem fueling the conflicts is that the 1986 federal law in question, the Stored Communications Act, is ill-suited to current cross-border data-storage practices.  In one case pending before the Supreme Court, a federal appeals court sided with Microsoft Corp. in holding that warrants for customer data can\u2019t be enforced on U.S. providers if the data are stored overseas.  The Justice Department and state attorneys general say the lower-court ruling has hindered investigations into an array of crimes, from narcotics trafficking to arson to child pornography. Electronic evidence is now critical to virtually every criminal investigation, they say.  But Microsoft, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google unit and other technology companies have argued the Justice Department\u2019s position would leave them caught in the middle between U.S. law-enforcement demands and their obligation to abide by privacy laws in foreign jurisdictions.  The Justice Department applied for a warrant requiring Microsoft to turn over email information from an account allegedly tied to illegal drug activity in the U.S. Microsoft handed over some account data that were stored in the U.S. but said it shouldn\u2019t have to hand over the emails, which were stored on a server in Ireland.  The companies say the case ultimately could threaten American dominance in the $250 billion cloud-computing industry, because foreign clients won\u2019t use U.S. firms if their data aren\u2019t protected.  The enactment of the Cloud legislation might leave little for the Supreme Court to decide in the Microsoft case. When the court heard oral arguments in February, multiple justices said congressional intervention would be welcome.  \"It would be good if Congress enacted legislation that modernized this,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito said.  Tech groups criticized the new measure\u2019s implications for privacy in several respects, casting it as a surrender of sorts in the wake of the Microsoft case.  \"The Cloud Act is a disappointing outcome after so many human-rights groups weighed in on the Microsoft case at the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.  EPIC and other groups had pushed for many updates to the 1980s-era privacy law, he said, \u201cbut they were ignored.\u201d Greg Nojeim of the Center for Democracy and Technology said the deal gives the Justice Department too much leeway to open up U.S. data to authoritarian foreign governments.  \u201cDOJ could use this legislation to diminish privacy rights world-wide, or to persuade other governments to raise their surveillance standards in order to qualify for an agreement,\u201c he said. \u201dWe fear the U.S. Congress hasn\u2019t done enough to require DOJ to make the right decisions.\u201d  \u201cThe internet industry applauds Congress for including the Cloud Act in the omnibus spending bill,\u201d said Melika Carroll, a senior vice president for the Internet Association, a trade group representing big tech companies. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we modernize U.S. privacy laws to reflect current realities of how data is stored around the world. Passing the Cloud Act will enable law enforcement to gather data stored abroad for the purposes of investigating serious crimes, while still protecting individual privacy rights.\u201d  \u2014Brent Kendall contributed to this article.

The tax is due regardless of whether they bring it home or not, though companies may choose to pay it over eight years. Businesses must generally book this tax as a one-time charge in the final quarter of 2017. Apple said this month it would pay $38 billion in taxes and return the majority of its overseas cash to the U.S.  The taxes companies pay on these profits will vary somewhat, depending on both the size of the profits and how they have been invested. Companies must pay 15.5% on liquid assets, such as cash and a variety of marketable securities, and 8% on other assets. Technology companies tend to have a larger amount of liquid assets as a share of their overseas stockpile than other industries: For instance, 95% of networking giant Cisco Systems Inc.\u2019s accumulated foreign profit last year was in cash and cash equivalents, versus 22% for retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  The Wall Street Journal estimated that 311 large publicly traded companies could generate nearly $250 billion in these taxes, of which 38% could be paid by tech companies.  Tax rates  Tech giants generally enjoy low effective tax rates because a portion of their profits accumulate in low-tax foreign jurisdictions. Tech firms paid an average tax rate of 24% over the 10-year period through 2016, below the 29% average tax rate for all companies in the S&P 500 for that period and lower than any other industry, according to an analysis of corporate filings by Zion Research Group.

That means firms like Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Cisco Systems, which over the past decade have paid lower tax rates on average than the new statutory rate of 21%, may soon see their rates go up. International Business Machines Inc., which paid a tax rate of 12% last year excluding one-time benefits, said this month its rate will rise to as much as 18% in 2018.  The five biggest tech companies\u2014 Apple Inc., Alphabet, Microsoft Corp. , Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. \u2014all report earnings this week and investors will be looking for guidance on tax rates.  Use of capital  Now that companies are free to bring foreign cash to the U.S. at no added cost, they will be dogged with the question of how they plan to spend it. Tech firms are already among the biggest spenders on research and development and on acquisitions. Adding to these budgets may not be the answer.

The Republicans sold the tax overhaul on the promise that it would return investment to the U.S., not to enrich shareholders.  \u201cIt will be interesting to see what companies ultimately do with more unfettered access to their global cash,\u201d said Kirsten Malm, a partner at law firm Baker McKenzie who advises tech firms on taxes. \u201cIs this going to set off a new wave of M&A? Will we see share buybacks? Maybe not, because share prices are so high at the moment.\u201d  Borrowing  With most of their cash sitting offshore, tech giants have increasingly issued debt to finance their growth and return money to shareholders. Tech firms in the S&P 500 collectively held nearly $566 billion in long-term debt in the most recent quarter, more than three times the amount they held just five years ago. That is a faster pace of growth than any other sector.  Racking Up Debt Tech companies acquired debt at a faster pace than any other sector in the S&P 500 over the last five years.

That includes Apple, with long-term debt of $97 billion; Microsoft, with $76 billion; and Oracle Corp. , with $58 billion.

It provides Fourth Amendment safeguards to prevent unreasonable searches of electronically stored communications \u2014 but says nothing about data held abroad.  The Court of Appeals concluded that the Stored Communications Act was not intended by Congress to allow searches outside the country. The ruling followed the well-established principle that American courts generally do not apply United States law beyond its borders unless Congress intended so.  But at least four federal courts have since refused to follow the ruling, mostly for practical, technology-driven reasons. The cases before those courts involved Google and Yahoo, which store data \u201cdynamically\u201d \u2014 breaking data into many small pieces and constantly shuttling it among storage centers in various countries to optimize performance and network efficiency. The text of an email might reside in Bulgaria, but the attachment in Spain.  Does it make any sense to think of this email as located in a specific country overseas? As a United States District Court judge, Juan R. S\u00e1nchez, wrote in an opinion that rejected the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling, \u201cno one knows which country to ask\u201d for the data.  Because Microsoft still frequently uses local-based storage, the Supreme Court case, though important, is of limited significance. The court has an opportunity to clarify the scope of the Stored Communications Act with respect to data stored \u201cstatically\u201d outside the United States. (When signing up for service, a Microsoft user indicates his or her country of residence and Microsoft usually stores the user\u2019s data in a nearby data center.) But the case does not address the more general question of the legal standards that govern information that crosses borders \u2014 and in particular, data stored \u201cdynamically.\u201d  Only Congress can address that larger question, by writing an urgently needed new law. (Even the Second Circuit appealed to Congress to step in.) The International Communications Privacy Act, introduced last term in Congress, is a good place to start. It provides a framework by which United States law enforcement can obtain communications of both United States and foreign citizens, consistent with the privacy protections afforded by international law.  The guiding principle should be that the reach of any new law is defined by the citizenship and geographical location of the individual whose data the government seeks, rather the physical location of the data. This would allow for the right balance between global privacy rights and the needs of United States law enforcement.  No matter how the Microsoft case is decided, if Congress fails to act, we will continue to have a legal system that inadequately governs the vast stores of electronic data that move seamlessly across international borders.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-26", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/opinion/united-states-searching-data-overseas.html"}, {"article": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google said on Tuesday it has made \u201cno changes\u201d to its mapping platform in China, denying an earlier media report that claimed it was re-launching the function in China, where many of its services are blocked.  Illustration photo of a Google Maps screen January 16, 2018. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration  Japan's Nikkei reported earlier that Google had set up a China-specific version of the Google Maps website for the first time in eight years and introduced a map application for Chinese iPhones for the first time. (s.nikkei.com/2DcmYjU)  Google, however, stated that the Google Maps browser has been available in China for many years while there is no Maps application offered in the country.  \u201cThere have been no changes to Google Maps in China. Maps has been accessible on desktop for years, but does not have an official presence in Android or iOS app stores in China,\u201d Google Spokesman Taj Meadows said in comments sent to Reuters.  A Chinese version of Google Maps was accessible on Tuesday on mobile and desktop browsers with certain functions available, but Reuters was unable to find a Google Maps app available in Chinese app stores.  Nikkei reported users could find an app, but if they tried to use features like navigation they were automatically transferred to an app from AutoNavi, a mapping company owned by China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding (BABA.N).  AutoNavi did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for a comment.  Google has tried to re-enter the China market, where its main search platform is blocked along with its popular video platform YouTube, limiting its access to China\u2019s internet users.  Google joined an investment in Chinese live-stream mobile game platform Chushou earlier this month after ramping up an artificial intelligence (AI) push last year, including launching an AI lab in December and hosting a match of the board game Go between its AI project Alpha Go and Chinese Go champion Ke Jie.  Last month, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai spoke at a high-profile tech event in China organized by the Cyberspace Administration of China, which oversees internet censorship.  A full Google Maps app has not been available in China since the company pulled many of its services in 2010 after refusing to self-censor its search results. Since then, it has maintained a limited presence in the world\u2019s top smartphone market.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-16", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-google-china-maps/google-says-no-changes-to-mapping-platform-in-china-after-report-idUKKBN1F42GL"}]
