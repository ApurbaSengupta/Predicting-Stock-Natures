MSFT -2.33% is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter earnings after the market closes Wednesday. Here\u2019s what to expect.  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence expect Microsoft to report per-share earnings of 86 cents under generally accepted accounting principles, up from 80 cents a year earlier. Microsoft no longer reports adjusted figures, reflecting accounting changes it adopted at the start of the fiscal year. The year ago figure reflects that change.  REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect Microsoft to post revenue of $28.41 billion, up from $25.83 billion a year earlier. The year-ago figure, too, reflects the new accounting standard.  WHAT TO WATCH:  CLOUDY CONDITIONS: In the last year, Microsoft has emerged as the primary competitor to Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s market-leading cloud-infrastructure business. Three months ago, Microsoft said its commercial-cloud run rate\u2014the last month of sales of its Azure infrastructure services and Office 365 products, multiplied by 12\u2014topped $20 billion, nine months ahead of the company\u2019s target. RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan, in a recent research report, said he expects 85% growth in Azure revenue and 42% growth in the commercial version of Office 365. Mr. MacMillan estimates Microsoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, will climb 10% to $7.4 billion in the quarter, and that its Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office, will grow 24% to $8.9 billion.  PLAYING GAMES: Microsoft\u2019s Xbox videogame console generally does its best business during the holiday quarter, and was primed to do particularly well with the debut of its Xbox One X console in November. Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Brad Reback wrote in a research note that Xbox outsold Sony Corp.\u2019s PlayStation 4 in December, but both were outsold by Nintendo Co.\u2019s Switch. Xbox is part of Microsoft\u2019s More Personal Computing segment, and the console\u2019s gains likely will be offset by continued sluggish PC sales, which track closely to the company\u2019s Windows operating system business. World-wide PC shipments grew 0.7% in the last quarter, according to International Data Corp. Mr. Reback estimates the segment, which is Microsoft\u2019s largest, will grow 0.6% to $11.96 billion.  TAXING TIMES: \u201cTax rate and repatriation commentary from a historically conservative management team represent the key wild card for the quarter,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss wrote in a research report. Mr. Weiss estimates Microsoft\u2019s tax rate will decline to 16% as a result of the tax-code overhaul President Donald Trump signed into law in December. A year ago, Microsoft\u2019s effective tax rate was 18%.  CASH CONSIDERATIONS: Mr. Weiss expects Microsoft to eventually repatriate cash held abroad, which totaled $132.1 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter, behind only Apple Inc.\u2019s $252.3 billion. He didn\u2019t speculate when Microsoft will bring the money to the U.S., but estimates the company will pay about $21 billion in taxes as a result of the tax law, which hits companies with a one-time tax of 15.5% on overseas profits held in cash and other liquid assets. RBC\u2019s Mr. MacMillan wrote about the potential for domestic acquisitions and shareholder returns through dividends or buybacks. Earlier this month, Apple said it would pay $38 billion in taxes as it brings home the vast majority of its overseas cash.

It\u2019s everything else.  Such was illustrated well on Tuesday when a late-market selloff hit the technology sector particularly hard. The Nasdaq Composite slid nearly 3%\u2014double the loss of the Dow. And the selling hit every segment, from internet companies to chip makers to software providers. Even Apple , AAPL -2.56% which kicked off the day with a cheery event designed to showcase new iPad and other offerings for the education market, shed 2.6% by the close.

It isn\u2019t clear if that vehicle was using Nvidia\u2019s chip products, and these chips are just a small part of its business, but the news still cast a pall over the stock.

Above, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks at CES earlier this year. Photo: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News  Nvidia NVDA -3.22% and Facebook are two very different companies. But both have recently come to learn a painful lesson: When tech is everywhere, so are the risks.  Facebook, of course, has been battered over its handling of user data. Nvidia\u2019s challenges are very different. The company, whose main business is making chips for videogames, has spent the past couple of years aggressively building chips designed to run self-driving cars. This has led to partnerships with several auto makers as well as companies like Uber, which has been developing its own fleet of autonomous vehicles.  But the problem with putting tech in the driver\u2019s seat is that the buck tends to stop there as well. One of Uber\u2019s self-driving cars was involved in a fatal accident on March 18. Nvidia\u2019s technology wasn\u2019t blamed for the incident, and CEO Jensen Huang said late Wednesday that Uber doesn\u2019t even use the company\u2019s self-driving car system.  But Nvidia still elected to temporarily suspend tests of the vehicles using its platform while investigating the matter. That has meant a lot of bucks for Nvidia\u2019s investors. The highflying stock has shed 12%\u2014nearly $18 billion in market value\u2014since the accident.  Nvidia still generates most of its sales from graphics chips used in videogames. But the company\u2019s significant advancements with artificial intelligence has opened the door to new and expansive opportunities. Companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are snapping up Nvidia\u2019s chips to deploy artificial intelligence capabilities in their data centers. Nvidia\u2019s sales into this segment more than doubled in the fiscal year ended January and are expected to surge more than 60% this year to about $3.2 billion. The company also told analysts on Tuesday that it now sees its total addressable market in this space as being worth about $50 billion in the next five years.  The opportunity for self-driving cars is further out. Nvidia is projected to get 5% of its total revenue from autos in the next two years, but much of that will come from infotainment systems, not autonomous vehicles. But while that may limit the actual business risk, Nvidia\u2019s name is now closely synced to the development of autonomous cars. That means mishaps involving those types of cars will likely weigh on the company\u2019s shares.  That is far different from Facebook, whose core business is under fire. Yet both stocks have fallen sharply over the past two weeks. Nvidia\u2019s was hit so hard in part because its market value has doubled over the past year.  That has put the chipmaker\u2019s value on par with that of much-larger tech names like IBM . Nvidia also is one of the more expensive chip stocks on the market at 35 times forward earnings, though its rapidly expanding bottom line has moderated that valuation a bit. The company\u2019s record to this point suggests it can still deliver on some outsize expectations. But investors should be ready for new twists in the road.

The logo for Twitter, which fell more than Facebook on Tuesday, on a phone post at the New York Stock Exchange in 2015. Photo: Richard Drew/Associated Press  The highflying technology stocks had been ignoring rising threats for a while. Reality reasserted itself on Tuesday.  The immediate cause for plummeting tech shares was company-specific: Chip maker Nvidia Corp. NVDA -3.22% halted road tests of driverless vehicles after an Uber Technologies Inc. test car was involved in a fatal crash, and Facebook Inc. FB -1.34% CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be hauled before Congress. The announcements highlighted the risks to two of the biggest tech disruption themes, self-driving cars and social media.  But the market fall wasn\u2019t just about Facebook and Nvidia, or even self-driving cars and social media, although the themes mattered, with Tesla Inc. dropping more than Nvidia, and Twitter Inc. TWTR -1.89% losing more than Facebook.  Instead, the market is waking up to an even broader threat: politics. It might also be sniffing another danger, from economics.  The political risk is obvious for Facebook, which stands at the unpleasant intersection of privacy fears and fake news. Facebook is accused of unwittingly aiding the manipulation of the U.S. election by Russian agents, of helping swing the Brexit referendum and, linked to both cases, failing to notice that the personal details of 50 million users had been snatched.  The arguments about who, what, where and why are far from being resolved, but Facebook highlights the forces gathering against tech investors. Disruptive companies are bound to make powerful enemies in old industries, but the tech companies have alienated many natural supporters among the wider public through their swagger, wealth and tax avoidance. Businesses that were once beloved by consumers for taking on the corporate establishment have become the corporate establishment in the eyes of many of their customers.  Cities and states were first to flex their muscles, forcing companies such as Uber and Airbnb Inc. to follow local rules and pay taxes. The threats now are much bigger.  The European Commission is pushing for a 3% tax on the revenue of internet giants, while pressure is increasing for \u201cgig economy\u201d workers to be treated as employees. The rush by companies to pull their ads from Facebook may be merely temporary, but it shows just how far the social network has slumped in public opinion and how much privacy is becoming an issue for Americans. In Europe, privacy rules have just been tightened again.  There is also a backlash to the sheer scale of many of the big internet companies. Earnest discussion among economists about the new monopolies is unlikely to lead directly to government intervention, but a change in public perception makes antitrust action more likely. Again, Europe has been leading the way by taking on Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google.  There is a further danger, from the economy. A stronger economy should mean more companies are able to demonstrate rising sales. Investors who want growth will be able to buy businesses exposed to the economic cycle, and the fast-expanding tech companies will lose some of their exclusivity in the minds of shareholders. The same point can be seen by looking at interest rates. As rates rise, profits far in the future look less attractive, which should compress the valuation of disrupters reinvesting all their earnings in the hope of future returns. If\u2014and it is a big if\u2014you expect the economy to improve and bond yields to rise, disruptive tech stocks should be less appealing.  Tech stocks rode high in the past three years, ignoring all these concerns as investors focused on the extraordinary profits and dominant market shares many were producing. Sentiment was overly positive, and the backlash was ignored.  It isn\u2019t always true that highflying stocks fall further, but it certainly was on Tuesday. Out of the top 100 stocks in the S&P 500 for the year to Monday, 39 were in the bottom 100 on Tuesday, about double what would be expected by chance. It worked the other way, too, with just over one-third of the bottom 100 stocks for the year in the top 100 on Tuesday, led by General Electric Co. , the fifth-worst performer this year and the best on Tuesday.  In the short run, the drop means the overly fast upward momentum of the big tech stocks has abated, leaving them less exposed to further selling driven by technical factors, although Amazon.com Inc. led more falls on Wednesday after a report that President Donald Trump wants to target the company.  In the longer run, expect lots of contrition from tech company CEOs as they try to head off political pressure on the bottom line.

TSLA -2.10% on Tuesday unleashed a bold pay package for Chief Executive Elon Musk that again ties his compensation entirely to key performance benchmarks. This time, the goals take the electric-car maker to cosmic heights, including an ultimate aim of hitting $650 billion in market value.  The pay plan, which shareholders must still approve, is designed to keep the 46-year-old billionaire as Tesla\u2019s top leader for years to come while also allowing for the possibility he will transition eventually from the day-to-day role of CEO into one of executive chairman and chief product officer.  The plan, which is modeled on the program set for Mr. Musk in 2012, entails a 10-year grant of stock options that would vest in 12 tranches, each with shares equal to 1% of the company\u2019s total shares outstanding as of Jan. 21, 2018. A tranche would vest only if a pair of milestones are achieved, one based on market value, the other on a measure of revenue or profit.  For example, the first tranche would vest if Tesla hits $100 billion in market value and either $20 billion in revenue or $1.5 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, after adjusting for stock compensation. For all 12 tranches to vest, Tesla\u2019s market value would have to reach $650 billion.  Tesla, which reported revenue of $7 billion for 2016, had a market value of about $58.8 billion as of Monday\u2019s close. Mr. Musk owns about 20% of the company, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.  Mr. Musk could net billions of dollars by hitting only a few of the milestones. Tesla said in a proxy filing the 20.26 million stock options today would have a preliminary value of about $2.62 billion. But if Tesla were to reach the audacious market value of $650 billion\u2014as much as Amazon.com Inc. is worth today\u2014the company said Mr. Musk\u2019s stock award would reap him as much as $55.8 billion fully vested.  That total, however, assumes the company\u2019s shares outstanding won\u2019t be diluted. Tesla has added tens of millions of shares over the past several years, so that total dollar figure is unlikely.  \u201cThis ensures that Elon will continue to lead Tesla\u2019s management over the long-term while also providing the flexibility to bring in another CEO who would report to Elon at some point in the future,\u201d Tesla said in a statement about the plan on Tuesday. \u201cAlthough there is no current intention for this to happen, it provides the flexibility as Tesla continues to grow to potentially allow Elon to focus more of his attention on the kinds of key product and strategic matters that most impact Tesla\u2019s long-term growth and profitability.\u201d  Tesla said that if none of the tranches are achieved, Mr. Musk wouldn\u2019t receive any compensation. That would put him in circumstances similar to those of some other prominent Silicon Valley leaders who own enormously valuable stakes in their companies but receive little or no salary.  Mr. Musk is saying, \u201cI want to set an audacious goal, and then if I achieve it, then pay me audaciously,\u201d said John Challenger, a longtime expert in corporate compensation as chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas. \u201cHe is in some ways capturing the spirit of Silicon Valley.\u201d  Mr. Musk\u2019s previous compensation program, granted in 2012, targeted a market value of $43.2 billion along with meeting certain milestones by 2022. It required him to remain CEO.  Adam Jonas, an analyst for Morgan Stanley, said the pay package is a \u201cmarketing tool\u201d to attract talent and raise more money as the company faces greater competition in making electric and self-driving vehicles. \u201cWe view this incentive package as more important to investor confidence than to Musk financially,\u201d Mr. Jonas wrote in a note to investors.  Since Tesla overtook Ford Motor Co.\u2019s market value last year, and flirted with that of General Motors Co. , the Silicon Valley auto maker\u2019s valuation has been a continual point of conversation. Critics question why investors are betting so much on a company that has yet to turn an annual profit and that has delivered a fraction of the sales of much larger auto makers.  Fans say they are betting on Mr. Musk\u2019s vision for personal transportation that includes electric cars that drive themselves and draw their power from Tesla\u2019s solar panels and storage batteries.  Such enthusiasm fueled Tesla\u2019s growth last year, even as Mr. Musk struggled to ramp up production of the Model 3 sedan in a test of his ability to transform a luxury niche player into a more mainstream auto maker.  Mr. Musk had previously committed the company to reaching a market cap of $700 billion, something he reiterated last year. \u201cI could be completely delusional, but I think I see a clear path to that outcome,\u201d he told analysts in May.  Mr. Musk, who also heads other companies including Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, has hinted that he might want to change his role at Tesla.  In May, an analyst asked Mr. Musk if he planned to step away from Tesla after bringing out the Model 3, as he had previously suggested.  \u201cI intend to be actively involved with Tesla for the rest of my life,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cHopefully, stopping before I get too old\u2014or too crazy, I don\u2019t know. But that doesn\u2019t mean I should be CEO forever.\u201d He suggested a role contributing in \u201cproduct design and technology.\u201d  Write to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com", "host": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-01-23T20:01:32Z", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-gives-elon-musk-new-10-year-pay-for-performance-deal-1516737688"}, {"article": "Elon Musk recently told attendees at the South by Southwest festival that two things are keeping him up at night: an apocalyptic future created by artificial intelligence, and production delays of Tesla Inc.\u2019s Model 3 car.

Photo: Matthias Balk/Zuma Press  International Business Machines Corp. IBM -2.25% announced a management revamp on Thursday, as it named a new finance chief while the current CFO takes a new role at the company.  James Kavanaugh will become senior vice president and finance chief effective Thursday. Mr. Kavanaugh is currently senior vice president, finance and operations, and previously served as IBM\u2019s vice president and controller.  He succeeds Martin Schroeter, who\u2014according to a company spokesman\u2014will take on a sales-focused role as senior vice president, global markets, effective Thursday. Mr. Schroeter was previously general manager of IBM Global Financing before becoming finance chief in January 2014.  It is typical for IBM to move leaders to new assignments in January, so we ensure we have the best talent in key roles for our business, the spokesman said.  \u201cMartin has been in the CFO role for four years and I think he\u2019s looking to get a broader operational experience for possible future roles at IBM,\u201d said Lou Miscioscia, managing director of Pivotal Research Group. \u201cHe\u2019s moving to a good spot.\u201d  The management changes come as IBM continues to struggle with its transition to higher-growth operations such as delivering pay-as-you-go services over the internet from older, shrinking businesses such as building and maintaining technology on customers\u2019 premises.  IBM\u2019s revenue slipped 0.4% from a year earlier, to $19.15 billion in the third quarter of 2017, marking it as the 22nd consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue declines.  \u201cIBM is long overdue for some fresh thinking in terms of strategy and positioning in the market,\u201d said Moshe Katri, analyst with Wedbush Securities Inc. The company\u2019s significant exposure to legacy products and services also exposes it to pricing pressure as that business is increasingly commoditized, he added.  \u201cThey could start with restructuring some problem or underperforming contracts in their services division,\u201d Mr. Katri said. Other companies in the sector have followed this strategy to improve their profitability, he said.  Both Mr. Schroeter and Mr. Kavanaugh will host IBM\u2019s fourth-quarter-earnings call, scheduled for January 18, 2018.  IBM has made no compensation decisions in connection with these appointments, the company said in a securities filing.

IBM -2.25% is scheduled to announce fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what to look for:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts expect IBM to report earnings of $5.17 a share on an adjusted basis, which typically omits items such as acquisition- and retirement-related charges, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. A year ago, IBM reported $5.01 in adjusted profit.  REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect total revenue of $22.05 billion for the quarter, up 1.3% from $21.77 billion a year earlier\u2014what would be the first growth after 22 consecutive quarters of declines.  WHAT TO WATCH:  GROWTH, BUT FOR HOW LONG?: One quarter of growth after more than five years of declines doesn\u2019t make a trend, some analysts caution. Fourth-quarter revenue was bolstered by two key factors, they say. First, foreign-exchange rates lately have shifted in IBM\u2019s favor after years of cutting into financial performance. They likely accounted for roughly 3% of revenue in the quarter, said Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein Research. Second, Q4 was the first full period that included sales of IBM\u2019s latest industrial-strength computers that process transactions for retailers, banks and the like. The mainframes, which IBM typically introduces every few years, typically boost revenue across several business lines. That effect is cyclical and bound to taper after a few quarters, Mr. Sacconaghi said.  SERVICES AHEAD: Knowing an eventual drop-off in mainframe revenue is down the line, investors will be looking for other areas to pick up the slack. IBM\u2019s two services segments, which include its consulting, IT hardware and software services and cloud operations, typically account for roughly 65% of total revenue. Both declined in recent quarters. \u201cFor IBM to get to revenue stability, which is what really matters for the stock multiple, services have to improve,\u201d said David Grossman of Stifel Financial Corp.  TAX IMPACT: Analysts are struggling to evaluate precisely how the U.S. tax-reform bill recently passed by Congress will affect IBM. The company has said its aggregate tax rate is around 15%, plus or minus 3 percentage points, but some analysts believe the new law may push it as high as 20%. The company held around $71 billion in cash overseas at the end of 2016, said Steve Milunovich of UBS AG , and repatriating some of that money could eat into earnings. IBM hasn\u2019t yet said what it expects to do with its stockpile in light of the new U.S. tax law.

Robert Pittenger would make some needed improvements to the Committee...", "host": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-03-18T17:35:35Z", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/proposed-tech-export-bill-goes-way-too-far-1521394453"}, {"article": "One can look at the transformational impact of IT on companies and industries through a variety of lenses, including products and services, revenue and profit, sales and support and market strategy. One of the most important such lenses is the impact of IT on business processes, that is, on how work is actually done across the various functions of an organization.  IT-driven business process has gone through three distinct phases. First came process automation in the early years of IT, where companies automated and improved their existing processes while leaving the underlying structure of the organization in place. Then came enterprise-wide process reengineering and management, where the job was to redesign the flow of work and integrate management of the various process within the enterprise. The third phase is now starting, focused on the processes and transactions that determine how institutions interact with each other around the world. Here, blockchain is set to play a role.  Automation, reengineering and integrated management of business processes have had a major impact on lowering the costs and improving the efficiency of transactions within a firm. But as we well know, the internet and globalization have significantly increased the volume of transactions and other interactions taking place among institutions around the world. The processes to manage the conduct of business among companies have not kept up with the economy\u2019s digital transformation, adding significant frictions and costs to their operations.  According to a 2016 IBM report, three major types of frictions predominate when conducting business among different institutions:  Information frictions: Participants in a transaction don\u2019t have access to the same information; the required information is not easily accessible; and security and privacy risks keep rising, \u2013 e.g., hacking, cybercrime, identity theft.  Interaction frictions: Intermediaries are needed to help deal with growing scale and complexity; transactions take longer due to arcane global processes; and a lack of trusted marketplaces in many economies around the world.  Innovation frictions: These include legacy systems, bureaucratic processes and institutional inertia; restrictive regulations that stifle innovation and change; and growing uncertainties and threats that make it harder to move forward.  Blockchains have the potential to significantly reduce these various frictions by bringing one of the most important and oldest concepts, the ledger, to the internet age. Ledgers constitute a permanent record of all the economic transactions an institution handles, whether it\u2019s a bank managing deposits, loans and payments; a brokerage house keeping track of stocks and bonds; a global company conducting business with its supply chain partners; or a government office recording births and deaths, the ownership and sale of land and houses, or legal identity documents like passports and driver licenses.  \u201cToday, transactions are recorded in multiple ledgers,\u201d noted the IBM report. \u201cEach one captures at best a moment in time and reflects the information held by a single party: Bank X purchased or sold a mortgage, for example. They don\u2019t record what happens next, what came before, or the role of others \u2013 partners, suppliers, consumers \u2013 in the transaction. Moreover, they\u2019re prone to human error and vulnerable to tampering. By contrast, distributed ledgers can be shared and updated in near real-time across a group of participants.\u201d  Blockchain technologies hold great promise for global supply chains ecosystems by increasing the speed, security and accuracy of financial and commercial settlements; tracking the supply chain lifecycle of any component or product; and securely protecting all the transactions and data moving through the supply chain. Blockchains provide an immutable, non-revocable record of all the transactions through the entire supply chain cycle, which will be of great help in the timely resolution of errors or disputes among supply chain partners.  In August, 2016 the World Economic Forum published an excellent report on The future of financial infrastructure, an ambitious look at how blockchain can reshape financial services. The report noted that blockchain technologies have the potential to transform the infrastructure and processes of the financial industry, bringing a diverse range of benefits including operational simplification, near-real time settlements among institutions, more accurate regulatory compliance and liquidity and capital improvements.  However, the report also warned that the evolution towards such a blockchain-based financial infrastructure and processes will take considerable time because it must overcome significant challenges. In particular, it will require the close collaborations of its various stakeholders around the world \u2014 including financial institutions, merchants and governments\u2013to develop the appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks.  This emerging third phase in the evolution of business process transformation is both promising and challenging, as we once more apply IT to make economies more efficient, this time involving the interactions of institutions and industries all around the world.

IBM is one of the big tech companies exploring ethical standards to guide the development of artificial intelligence. Photo: brian snyder/Reuters  WASHINGTON\u2014Technology companies are racing to get ahead of regulators to shape the future of artificial intelligence as it moves deeper into our daily lives.  Companies are already working artificial intelligence, or AI, into their business models, but the technology remains controversial. So IBM Corp. , Intel Corp. and associations representing Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google unit are seeking to set ethical standards, or a sort of code of conduct, through alliances with futurists, civil-rights activists and social scientists.  Critics, however, see it as an effort to blunt outside regulation by cities, states or the federal government, and they question if tech companies are best suited to shape the rules of the road. For the corporations, the algorithms will be proprietary tools to assess your loan-worthiness, your job application, and your risk of stroke. Many balk at the costs of developing systems that not only learn to make decisions, but that also explain those decisions to outsiders.  When New York City proposed a law in August requiring that companies publish source code for algorithms used by city agencies, tech firms pushed back, saying they needed to protect proprietary algorithms. The city passed a scaled-back version in December without the source-code requirement.  \u201cThey\u2019re hiding behind trade secrets so you can\u2019t even get a look at what people are doing,\u201d said Ryan Calo, a University of Washington law professor who has advised Congress members on AI issues.  AI, broadly speaking, refers to computers mimicking intelligent behavior, crunching big data to make judgments on anything from avoiding car accidents to where the next crime might happen.  Yet computer algorithms aren\u2019t always clear on their logic. If a computer consistently denies a loan to members of a certain sex or race, is that discrimination? Will regulators have the right to examine the algorithm that made the decision? What if the algorithm doesn\u2019t know how to explain itself?  From the Archives Executives from Baidu, Intel, Samsung and Walmart talk about how artificial intelligence will soon redefine our technological lives. They speak at the WSJ D.Live conference in Laguna Beach, Calif. (Originally published Oct. 18, 2017)  The Obama administration sought to address these issues. Under Mr. Obama, the Office of Science and Technology Policy issued white papers on the ethical implications on AI. Under Mr. Trump, the office still doesn\u2019t have a director, and its staff is down to about 45, from about 130. A spokesman for the office declined to comment.  For now, the Trump administration has signaled it wants business to take the lead. The administration is worried overarching regulation could constrain innovation and make the U.S. less competitive, Michael Kratsios, the deputy in charge of tech policy at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, said at a conference in February. He noted China\u2019s push into artificial intelligence, which it is doing without much ethical quibbling.  \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for, or will be endorsing, broad, high level guidelines about AI rules,\u201d Mr. Kratsios said. He called it \u201ckey\u201d to create \u201cthe regulatory environment that ensures that the next great technologies happen here in the U.S.\u201d  In the past six months, Intel, IBM, Workday Inc. and the Washington, D.C.-based Information Technology Industry Council\u2014whose members include Facebook, Apple and Google\u2014all issued principles on the ethical use of artificial intelligence. In January, Microsoft Corp. put out an entire book on \u201cArtificial Intelligence and its Role in Society.\u201d  In 2016, some of the biggest tech companies founded an ethics-setting organization called the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society, based in San Francisco. There are many others with at least some industry funding, including Open AI, the AI Now Institute, doteveryone, and the Center for Democracy & Technology.  Proposed rules have ranged from specific guidelines for government use, to requirements that any algorithm be able to explain its process to consumers. Many would apply existing regulations to AI case-by-case, adapting aviation rules to drones or applying privacy protections to personal data in algorithms.  Setting rules is complicated because companies often can\u2019t explain how their more complex systems, called \u201cdeep neural networks,\u201d arrive at answers. Last year, University of Washington researchers reported that an algorithm that had learned\u2014by itself\u2014to distinguish between wolves and husky dogs appeared to be doing so by noticing snow on the ground in the wolf pictures, not because of any insight into the animal.  \u201cGoogle, Facebook, those guys are very interested in performance and making these programs as smart as they can,\u201d said Dave Gunning, who leads a project into making algorithms explain their processes for the government\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.  \u201cExplainability is not as important to them,\u201d Mr. Gunning said. Google and Facebook didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  At least one business executive, Elon Musk, founder and chief executive of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, has cut back his role in the ethical research group he co-founded, Open AI. Mr. Musk quit the group\u2019s board in February. The group said he wanted to \u201celiminate a potential future conflict of interest\u201d with his role at Tesla, which is developing AI systems. He remains an Open AI adviser and funder.  Some in Congress are taking up the ethical debate. Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell and Maryland Rep. John Delaney, both Democrats, led a bipartisan bill introduced in December to establish a federal advisory council on the technology\u2019s potential impact. There is also an AI caucus on the Hill, started in may, and committees have been holding hearings on AI, algorithms and autonomous vehicles. The European Union has already set regulations for AI algorithms, that are set to take effect in May.  Human-resources software maker Workday, which uses Ai algorithms, assumes that either now, or sometime soon, the U.S. will start to set guidelines.  \u201cOur engagement now is in anticipation that one day there will be government regulation related to AI,\u201d said senior vice president Jim Shaughnessy. He said Workday wants to \u201censure a regulatory framework that serves society\u2019s needs while allowing the potential of AI, and its benefits, to flourish.\u201d", "host": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-03-13T09:30:17Z", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/artificial-intelligence-rules-more-of-your-life-who-rules-ai-1520933401"}, {"article": "Humanoid robots are getting better at walking, talking and looking like humans.

Oxford Economics, a forecasting and consulting firm, estimates the legislation will contribute 0.4 percentage points to already-robust economic growth in 2018, and another 0.1 to 0.2 points in 2019, said Gregory Daco, head of U.S. economics for the consultancy.  About half of that is likely to come from business spending, and the rest from households, Mr. Daco said. Oxford estimates that each $1 of corporate tax cut will lead to 40 cents of spending, based on historical precedent, Congressional Budget Office studies and conversations with corporate executives.  That\u2019s mostly a one-time gain. A reduction in taxes frees up profits to spend, but that then becomes the new normal, with further growth coming from general economic expansion or other factors.  At Amicus Therapeutics, the new tax law solved a geographic dilemma. The Cranbury, N.J., company is developing an experimental drug to treat Pompe disease, a rare inherited disorder that causes muscle weakness and can be fatal.  After early results for a new drug proved promising, Amicus wanted to increase production for further clinical testing and potential commercial sales.  Amicus, which has been using Chinese contract manufacturer WuXi Biologics to supply the drug, decided in August to build its own facility. The U.S. was at a disadvantage to Europe, due to its 35% statutory federal income-tax rate for companies. Ireland\u2019s corporate tax rate, by contrast, is 12.5%.  Those financial considerations threatened to overshadow other advantages that a U.S. plant would offer, including the ease with which company officials could visit it, and the availability of talented workers in some regions.  \u201cOur strong assumption was that it would be very challenging to establish a new bio-manufacturing facility in the U.S.,\u201d Chief Executive John Crowley said in an interview.  As the tax legislation advanced in Congress last fall, however, building in the U.S. began to look more attractive. On Dec. 21, a day after Congress passed the final measure, which lowered the statutory corporate rate to 21%, Mr. Crowley recommended to his board the company focus on finding a U.S. site. The company has narrowed its choice to three East Coast cities Mr. Crowley declined to identify, and expects to decide in the next month or two. It expects the plant to cost $150 million to $200 million, and to employ at least 200 people at an average pay of $100,000 a year.  Amicus Therapeutics Chief Executive John Crowley, right, chose the U.S. over Europe for a new production facility. Photo: Melissa Golden for The Wall Street Journal  \u201cWith the changes in the tax law, it now makes the U.S. competitive with these geographies we\u2019re looking at,\u201d he said.  The rules of deal making, too, are changing. In the past two months, Aramark completed two acquisitions with a price tag of $2.35 billion as it snapped up hotel procurement and supply firm Avendra in December and uniform-rental and linen-supply firm AmeriPride Services Inc. last week.  Both are a kind of deal that, thanks to the new tax law, has become cheaper. One provision lets companies deduct the cost of buying some sorts of assets immediately, instead of over several years as prior tax law required\u2014and expanded this treatment to used assets as well as new ones.  That essentially lets a buyer like Aramark get an immediate discount on the cash cost of part of its deals, the portion that reflects the acquisition of equipment, machinery and other tangible property.  Aramark\u2019s acquisition of Avendra, a partnership, is automatically treated as an asset purchase, New York tax consultant Robert Willens notes, while deal documents indicate Aramark and AmeriPride agreed to treat that acquisition as an asset purchase as well for tax purposes. (Although the Avendra deal closed in December, the new tax treatment applies to assets acquired after late September.)  \u201cThe cost of deals structured in this manner have taken a turn for the better,\u201d Mr. Willens said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a full 21% discount.\u201d  In news releases, Aramark described its after-tax cost for the two deals as $1.86 billion, 21% less than the pretax price. Aramark said in a statement that it continues to evaluate the impact of the new tax law with accounting firm KPMG LLP, and plans to update investors on the acquisitions when it reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 6.  The same provision, speeding up tax deductions for capital spending, has prompted Kimberly-Clark, the diaper- and tissue-maker, to accelerate at least one major project, CEO Tom Falk said. The company\u2019s board votes next month on a U.S. factory retooling expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. There wasn\u2019t a timeline for the project previously.  \u201cIt gives us more incentive to invest, particularly in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Falk said in an interview. \u201cThe project made sense before the tax benefit. It makes more sense after the tax benefit.\u201d  Similar reconsiderations are under way elsewhere. At United Natural Foods Inc., a grocery distributor with about 10,000 employees and more than $9 billion in annual revenue, the tax law has prompted a wholesale re-evaluation.  Projects previously viewed as risky are being given new consideration, Mike Zechmeister, the company\u2019s finance chief, said in an interview. The return on investment improved by 4 percentage points on a warehousing project in the Pacific region of the U.S. that the company had already decided to pursue, he said, primarily because of the new lower tax rate.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to impact all the decisions we make,\u201d Mr. Zechmeister said. \u201cAlmost all investments look better from an investment standpoint because we won\u2019t have to pay as much tax.\u201d  Grocery distributor United Natural Foods Inc. is investing to overcome capacity bottlenecks. Photo: United Natural Foods  The tax break comes at a particularly good time for United Natural Foods, which has struggled to keep pace with surging demand for natural and organic goods. The company\u2019s net sales rose 8% year-over-year during its last quarter to $2.5 billion, driven largely by Whole Foods, the chain acquired by Amazon.com Inc . last year and United Natural\u2019s biggest customer.  That sudden growth proved costly. The Providence, R.I., company had an additional $25 million in lost sales from out-of-stock goods during its last quarter, along with higher labor costs and storage fees. Any expansion would help ease capacity bottlenecks that the company intends to resolve in coming months.  Some companies are holding pat, either because they want to see how the new rules shake out, or because they are worried about moving too fast.  Verizon said it would use most of its tax savings\u2014$3.5 billion to $4 billion in extra cash in 2018\u2014to pay down some of its $117 billion debt, rather than increase investments. It will also donate to its charity and give employees company stock.  Mr. McAdam, the Verizon CEO, said the wireless giant would remain disciplined about capital spending. \u201cIt\u2019s very inconsistent that just because tax reform comes through, we are all of a sudden going to draw the line at a different place or lose that discipline,\u201d he said on Tuesday.  Several firms have announced plans to plow most of their tax savings into dividends or share repurchases, about a third of which flow to foreign investors, by some estimates.  Bank of America Corp. is exploring how it might invest in branches, technology and its workforce, CEO Brian Moynihan told investors last week. \u201cHowever, to be clear, we\u2019d expect most of the benefits from tax reform will flow to the bottom line through dividends and share buybacks over time,\u201d he added. A spokesman said payouts to shareholders will also help local economies.  The tax overhaul is altering corporate operations in sometimes surprising ways. Netflix Inc., for example, has changed the compensation it will pay three of its top officers, raising their salaries by a combined $19 million.  Its reasoning: The new tax law prevents companies from deducting any sort of pay over $1 million apiece for key executives. Prior law allowed companies to deduct that pay if it was tied to performance. So, having lost the benefit of a tax deduction for paying performance-based bonuses instead of salary, Netflix announced days after the tax law was passed that its board was scrapping the performance measures and converting the pay into straight salary instead, as it used to do before 2014.  The tax-law change is likely to eliminate tax deductions on $92 billion of pay, according to an analysis of Russell 3000 firms by Equilar. Several large companies\u2014including Johnson Controls International PLC and drugmaker AmerisourceBergen Corp. \u2014have said their boards are considering how the tax change affects their approach to compensation. Willis Towers Watson , a compensation-consulting firm, found that 40% of 333 employers it surveyed were either considering executive-pay changes or had already made some.  The ripple effects are hitting small businesses, too. Matthew Wells, president of Western Mechanical Contractors Inc. in Federal Way, Wash., is considering whether to restructure how his business is organized to maximize his benefits under the new tax law.  The 32-person plumbing and mechanical contracting firm is currently set up as an S corporation, a so-called pass-through structure in which the business itself isn\u2019t taxed and its income goes to the owners, who reflect it on their individual tax returns.  Mr. Wells is trying to determine whether his tax bill would fall if he switched to a C corporation, which pays its own income taxes directly to the Internal Revenue Service\u2014now at a 21% rate, down from a top rate of 35% before the new law.  Mr. Wells\u2019 accountant is still poring over the new law, but has suggested the potential benefits may not be as great as the contractor initially believed. \u201cI think they are going to try and talk us out of it,\u201d said Mr. Wells. \u201cBut it is certainly something we are looking into.\u201d  Christmas may be over but WSJ\u2019s Richard Rubin keeps the holiday spirit alive by explaining who\u2019s getting presents and who\u2019s getting coal with the GOP tax bill.  \u2014Sharon Terlep, Ruth Simon and Ryan Knutson contributed to this article.

Roughly two years after its launch as a self-described \u201cpost-cable network,\u201d Cheddar has raised $22 million, according to founder and Chief Executive Jon Steinberg.  The funding round, the company\u2019s fourth, was led by Raine Ventures, an early-stage media-and-technology investment firm. Other investors include Liberty Global , LBTYA -2.70% Goldman Sachs, Antenna Group, 7 Global Capital, Dentsu Ventures, New York Stock Exchange owner Jeffrey Sprecher and Kelly Loeffler, chief communications and marketing officer of Intercontinental Exchange. Previously, Cheddar raised $32 million in three rounds led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and Raine Ventures.  The company is now valued at $160 million, up from $85 million after the last fundraising round, Mr. Steinberg said.  Mr. Steinberg, the former president of BuzzFeed, has pitched Cheddar as a disrupter of cable news networks aimed at millennials who are cutting the cord and turning away from traditional news. About 95 percent of the company\u2019s revenue comes from advertising, Mr. Steinberg said, mostly native ad sponsorships from big-ticket advertisers like Fidelity and E-Trade that start at $125,000 per month.  The company has booked $18 million in revenue for 2018, Mr. Steinberg said, mostly from advertisers who\u2019ve signed six- to 12-month deals. The remaining revenue comes mostly from selling shows to networks and platforms such as Fusion and Spotify. The company finished 2017 with $11.3 million in revenue.  Mr. Steinberg said Cheddar is hoping to forge distribution partnerships with new investors Liberty Global, a cable giant, and Antenna Group, which owns television stations in Greece, Serbia, Slovenia and Montenegro. He\u2019s optimistic that the investment from Dentsu Ventures will give Cheddar an entr\u00e9e to Japan.  Cheddar, which has about 130 employees, isn\u2019t planning to grow its headcount drastically over the next year, Mr. Steinberg said. By the end of 2019, he expects the company will have fewer than 200 employees, part of an effort to keep expenses to a minimum. In December, Cheddar had operating expenses of $1.5 million and was nearly profitable, Mr. Steinberg said. This year, he doesn\u2019t expect costs to break more than $2 million monthly.  \u201cIt will certainly cost something to go international, but I raised the money to get this great group of investors involved,\u201d Mr. Steinberg said. \u201cTo have Liberty and Antenna partner to take us onto their systems. For now the cash is in the bank. We have more than enough cash to invest in what we want, get profitable and never raise again.\u201d  It hasn\u2019t been determined yet whether Liberty and Antenna would distribute Cheddar on their linear TV systems or over the top, Mr. Steinberg said.  Some of the money from the raise will go toward building a second news network, called Cheddar Big News. The streaming network will focus on general-interest happenings in the mode of local TV news. The network, which will cost between $1 and $1.5 million to launch, is scheduled to debut in April, Mr. Steinberg said.  The company is also planning to launch a channel on Snapchat Discover in April focused on business and tech news.  Cheddar is moving away from a strategy, announced shortly after its launch, to focus on subscriptions as a revenue stream, Mr. Steinberg said. The company put up a paywall in May 2016 and charged users $6.99 per month for access to its content but has since shifted to a strategy of launching with over-the-top bundles like Sling, Philo, X1 and Molotov, Mr. Steinberg said. The company will allow its users to log into its apps and websites with their credentials from those companies.  Although the media industry is facing serious challenges including fierce competition for advertising by companies like Facebook and Google, Raine Ventures decided to invest because of Cheddar\u2019s potential to disrupt the existing pay-TV business model, said Gordon Rubenstein, managing partner at Raine Ventures.  \u201cWe don\u2019t think of Cheddar as a traditional media company,\u201d said Mr. Rubenstein, who sits on Cheddar\u2019s board. \u201cThis is a post-cable network. And we think it\u2019s a next-generation, global news and information platform that is thinking about the industry differently than any company we\u2019ve seen in this space.\u201d", "host": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-03-19T20:13:12Z", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cheddar-the-cnbc-for-millennials-raises-22-million-for-international-expansion-1521487261"}, {"article": "Commuters browse on their smartphones as they wait for a train in a subway station in New York City.  Commuters browse on their smartphones as they wait for a train in a subway station in New York City. Photo: JEWEL SAMAD/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images  Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL -2.20% Google unveiled new technology that lets publishers create visual-oriented stories in a mobile-friendly format similar to the style popularized by Snapchat and Instagram.  Starting Tuesday, publishers will be able to try out a developer preview of AMP stories, which feature swipeable slides of text, photos, graphics and videos, Google announced in a blog post.  Publishers including Vox Media, Cond\u00e9 Nast, Meredith Corp. MDP -0.74% and Time Warner Inc.\u2019s CNN were involved in the early development of the technology and have already begun creating such stories for the mobile web.  AMP stories are reminiscent of the immersive, vertical stories pioneered by Snap Inc.\u2019s SNAP -0.97% Snapchat, which spurred copycat features from social-media rivals. In 2016, Facebook Inc.\u2019s Instagram launched Instagram Stories, a swipeable product that has also gained traction among many publishers.  With publishers eager to make money from the rising tide of consumers viewing content on mobile devices, tech companies also have introduced products designed to aggregate news and speed the loading of articles on mobile, including Apple Inc.\u2019s Apple News app and Facebook\u2019s Instant Articles.  Unlike those products, however, AMP stories don\u2019t yet allow advertising to be incorporated. Google is in the process of building support for ads but didn\u2019t disclose a time frame. Meanwhile, the lack of monetization on AMP stories threatens to slow its adoption among publishers.  Even though creating AMP stories won\u2019t pay immediate dividends, several publishing executives expressed willingness to experiment with the format in the hopes of an eventual payoff.  AMP stories with CNN, Mic, SBNation and the Washington Post. Photo: CNN, Mic, SBNation, Washington Post  \u201cGoogle has a track record of delivering a return on investment in the longer run,\u201d said Regina Buckley, senior vice president of digital business development at Meredith, the magazine and online publisher that recently acquiredTime Inc. \u201cAnd we\u2019re willing to take a leap of faith on that.\u201d  Google\u2019s AMP stories format builds on code from its Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project, a framework that allows publishers to create webpages that load much faster than conventional pages on the mobile web. The format has been met with mixed reactions. Some publishers have praised AMP for sending them additional traffic from search and speeding up their pages, while others have criticized the format for being too bare bones to allow for the full spectrum of digital ads, reducing their revenue per pageview.  Google is rolling out AMP stories gradually. Beginning Tuesday, users can find the stories by searching for one of the participating publishers on Google or following a link on a mobile browser to a test version of the stories.  Google will monitor reactions to AMP stories over the coming months and consider integrating them more fully into search, which could eventually lead to a separate section for AMP stories on a Google search results page.  Although Google hasn\u2019t promised that AMP stories will receive a bump in search traffic, the prospect of additional readership is one incentive to try out the technology, said Joe Alicata, chief product officer at Vox Media. He added that Vox Media would make the format available to advertisers if ads become supported.  Google paid publishers to help develop the AMP stories technology, said Rudy Galfi, a product manager at Google. He declined to say how much or whether the payments will continue, only that the money helped publishers cover their costs during the development period. Hearst Corp., Mashable, Mic and the Washington Post were also involved in the early development of the format.  S. Mitra Kalita, vice president for programming at CNN Digital, said she hopes CNN will draw additional search traffic with AMP stories, but she is taking a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach to further investment.  \u201cI don\u2019t look at it in a vacuum,\u201d Ms. Kalita said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to evaluate it on the revenue, the resources it takes to put out, the traffic potential and the numbers of users reached.\u201d", "host": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-02-13T05:30:04Z", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-new-amp-stories-bring-snapchat-like-content-to-the-mobile-web-1518499801"}, {"article": "Snapchat has a message for television broadcasters: We\u2019re friends, not enemies.

Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google is likely to command of 37.2% of the U.S. digital advertising market, down from 38.6% last year, according to research company eMarketer. Photo: mike blake/Reuters  Google and Facebook Inc. FB -1.34% have dominated the U.S. digital advertising market for years, earning them the title of \u201cthe digital duopoly\u201d and leaving competitors scrambling for crumbs. But now there are signs that platforms like Amazon and Snapchat are chipping away at their market share.  In its latest forecast, research company eMarketer predicts the combined U.S. digital ad market share of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL -2.20% Google and Facebook will fall for the first time this year, shrinking to 56.8% from 58.5% last year. At the same time, overall digital ad spending in the country is likely to grow nearly 19% to $107 billion in 2018.  To be sure, Google and Facebook are still increasing their total ad revenue significantly, and no other competitor even cracks 5% market share. But those smaller rivals are growing more quickly than expected and are seeking a larger share of the pie.  Google\u2019s U.S. revenue from digital advertising is expected to increase about 15% this year to $39.92 billion, while Facebook\u2019s would jump 17% to $21 billion, according to eMarketer\u2019s forecast.  That would give Google command of 37.2% of the market, down from 38.6%. Facebook\u2019s market share will likely be 19.6%, down from 19.9%, the first time eMarketer has projected such a decline for the social-media company. Google\u2019s market share contracted for the first time in 2016.  Google and Facebook declined to comment.  Related Video \u200bGoogle handles 90% of the world's internet searches, and it increasingly is promoting a single answer for many questions. Even subjective or unanswerable queries sometimes get seemingly definitive answers. Here's how the algorithms are -- and aren't -- working. Video/Photo Illustration: Heather Seidel/The Wall Street Journal  Advertisers\u2019 relationships with Google and Facebook have grown tense in recent years amid controversies over ads appearing next to inappropriate content, measurement discrepancies, and questions over the tech companies\u2019 roles in Russia\u2019s efforts to spread misinformation to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  EMarketer\u2019s estimate for Google and Facebook\u2019s combined share of the market in 2017 was revised down to 58.5% from a forecast in September of about 63%, because the overall market grew more than projected to $90.4 billion last year.  In the same September forecast, eMarketer predicted that both companies would achieve a slight uptick in total market share in 2018. But the firm has since adjusted its estimates to account for other digital companies experiencing \u201cfaster-than-expected growth,\u201d according to the report.  While it is a relatively small player in the digital ad industry so far, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -3.20% is among the companies emerging as a potential rival to the duopoly. The retail giant is projected to bring in $2.89 billion in U.S. digital advertising this year, a 64% increase over 2017.  Amazon, the fifth-largest digital ad player on eMarketer\u2019s list, is likely to capture 2.7% of the U.S. market this year. But by 2020, the firm expects Amazon to jump to third place, surpassing Verizon Communication Inc.\u2019s Oath and Microsoft Corp. , with $6.4 billion in digital ad sales in the U.S.  \u201cSo far, it\u2019s been conservative in its ad load. It remains an open question as to when Amazon will take advantage of its significant reach and dominance in shopper data to ramp up the placement of ads in other areas,\u201d said eMarketer senior forecasting director Monica Peart in the report.  Amazon didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.  Snap Inc., though still a small competitor, is forecast to grow its U.S. digital ad revenue by 82% to more than $1 billion in 2018 while increasing its share to 1%, according to eMarketer.  Instagram, the photo-sharing app owned by Facebook, is becoming an advertising powerhouse in its own right. Breaking out the estimates for just Instagram, the app is expected surpass 5% market share with $5.48 billion in U.S. digital ad revenue, eMarketer said.  \u201cFacebook\u2019s user growth in the U.S. has slowed down and is now about the same as that of internet users, while News Feed ad prices may be reaching their limit,\u201d Ms. Peart said. \u201cMeanwhile, Instagram, with its rapidly increasing advertiser base, will quickly become the engine that drives growth for the whole.\u201d  Twitter faces more obstacles. The social-media company\u2019s digital ad revenue in the U.S. is expected to decrease 4.9% to $1.12 billion in 2018. The company\u2019s market share would ease to 1%. However, eMarketer expects Twitter to return to positive growth in 2019, with an expected 5.5% increase in revenue.

Lucy Peng, a billionaire who was one of the original founders of Alibaba, will become the chief executive of Lazada. Photo: Long Wei/Featurechina/Ropi/Zuma Press  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.93% Executive Chairman Jack Ma is doubling down on Southeast Asia, investing another $2 billion in e-commerce subsidiary Lazada Group and naming trusted confidante Lucy Peng as its chief executive.  The investment announced Monday comes on top of the $2 billion the Chinese e-commerce giant has poured into Lazada since buying a majority stake in 2016.  Singapore-based Lazada operates online marketplaces in six Southeast Asian countries including Indonesia, selling everything from lipstick and car wax to instant coffee and smartphones.  Ms. Peng, a billionaire who helped found Alibaba in 1999, will replace Lazada founder Max Bittner as CEO. Ms. Peng is currently chairwoman of Lazada and will retain that role.  The 46-year-old Ms. Peng helped build Alibaba\u2019s mobile-payment affiliate Ant Financial Services Group\u2014previously known as Alipay\u2014serving as chief executive from 2010 to 2016, and still serves as its chairwoman.  In a 2016 letter to employees, Mr. Ma said Ms. Peng was a \u201crock-steady presence in the face of changing times,\u201d and that \u201cLucy is Alibaba\u2019s soul mate.\u201d  The new investment and the promotion of Ms. Peng show the importance of Southeast Asia to Alibaba, which has been expanding there as growth at home slows.  The region is home to about 600 million people, and is increasingly attracting the interest of global e-commerce companies eager to get a foothold as more people get internet access and shop online, largely via smartphones.  U.S. e-commerce behemoth Amazon.com Inc. launched its Prime Now fast delivery option in Singapore last July. Chinese online retailer JD.com and Tencent Holdings Ltd -backed Sea Holdings Ltd. also operate e-commerce platforms or have joint ventures in the region.  Southeast Asia\u2019s e-commerce market has grown more than 40% annually since 2015 to reach $10.9 billion in revenue last year, according to a December report co-written by Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Temasek Holdings. The market is expected to grow to $88.1 billion by 2025, the report forecast.  Alibaba owns about 83% of Lazada. The subsidiary helped Alibaba almost double its international commerce retail revenues to $727 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31, the company said in a statement in February, describing markets in the region as \u201cin the early innings of the game\u201d and pledging to continue investing there.  Still, international commerce retail revenues are a fraction of what Alibaba earns at home, with its Chinese commerce revenues hitting $9.2 billion in the same quarter.

The \u201cnotorious markets\u201d list, published Friday by the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office, names online or physical marketplaces believed to facilitate the sale of pirated goods. The latest version again blames Russian social-media network VKontakte.com for allegedly allowing the exchange of Hollywood movies, as well as naming six physical markets in China blamed for allowing counterfeit goods to be sold or not making enough progress to defend intellectual property.  The annual U.S. review, released for the first time by the Trump administration, once again included the Taobao online platform of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.93%  The Obama administration a year ago had reinstated Taobao on the list, provoking protests from Alibaba, which says it has taken efforts to prevent the sale of counterfeit goods.  \u201cAs a result of the rise of trade protectionism, Alibaba has been turned into a scapegoat by the USTR to win points in a highly politicized environment,\u201d an Alibaba spokesman said on Friday.  \u201cAlibaba reiterates our point of view: We will continue to strengthen our IP protection system with world-leading technology,\u201d he said.  A spokesman for VKontakte said the company \u201ccontinues active work on licensing audio and video content through the social network\u201d and is also helping to limit access to disputed content when copyright holders show ownership.  Alibaba has formed an alliance with foreign brands including Louis Vuitton to leverage the Chinese company\u2019s data-analysis capability to fight fakes on its online retail platforms.  The list typically focuses on emerging markets with lax enforcement of copyright and trademarks, but this year\u2019s version included a marketplace outside Toronto, from a developed economy, a U.S. neighbor and top trading partner that is currently in tense negotiations with the U.S. and Mexico to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement.  A spokeswoman for the Canadian government didn\u2019t immediately comment.  A U.S. official on Friday told reporters that the \u201creport covers a wide variety of illustrative markets,\u201d and that Canada is \u201cnot unique.\u201d  The list names and shames companies and countries that allegedly don\u2019t take steps to stop counterfeiters, but doesn\u2019t set official U.S. policy. Still, the prominence of the list can bring significant pressure in Washington\u2019s international negotiations and interactions with companies, and U.S. lawmakers frequently cite the markets included on the list.  The latest version targets the Pacific Mall in Markham, Ontario, which U.S. officials call a \u201cwell-known market for the sale of counterfeit and pirate goods for over a decade.\u201d The mall\u2019s website bills the facility, opened in 1997, as the \u201clargest Chinese shopping mall in North America.\u201d  \u201cVendors in Pacific Mall appear to operate largely with impunity, and requests for assistance from local law enforcement have reportedly gone unanswered,\u201d U.S. officials said.  A representative from the mall didn\u2019t immediately reply to requests to comment on the U.S. accusations. Canadian authorities have previously targeted vendors in the mall for alleged sale of pirated DVDs.  Besides Canada, the U.S. list took issue with markets in other developed economies including Italy and Spain.  The Trump administration, backed by Republican lawmakers, appears to be making a bigger effort to promote international-intellectual property rights of U.S. pharmaceutical companies and Hollywood studios. The Obama administration defended intellectual property but also frequently addressed concerns in the U.S. and abroad about the affordability of medicine and the need for technology companies to engage in \u201cfair use\u201d of copyrighted content.  \u2014Liza Lin in Shanghai contributed to this article.

The Tongzhou Wanda Plaza shopping mall in Beijing is operated by Dalian Wanda Group Co., which is controlled by Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin. Photo: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg News  An investor group that includes China\u2019s Tencent Holdings Ltd. and online retailer JD.com Inc. JD -2.39% is spending 34 billion yuan ($5.37 billion) for a 14% stake in Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin\u2019s commercial-property company as he faces a deadline to relist the business in China.  Wanda, China\u2019s largest mall developer, is benefiting from an escalating war for consumers and data between Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.93% , the country\u2019s two largest internet companies.  Alibaba has already established several partnerships with department-store and supermarket chains in China, and is seeking to integrate online retail with physical stores.  Tencent has invested in Alibaba\u2019s online shopping rival JD.com, and the deal announced Monday gives both a partner in China\u2019s shopping-mall business as they seek to blunt Alibaba\u2019s move into physical stores. The traditional stores are seen as a way to attract new customers and, for Tencent and Alibaba, as a means to expand their mobile payment platforms.  \u201cThe deal represents one of the world\u2019s largest single strategic investments between internet companies and brick-and-mortar commercial giants,\u201d parent company Dalian Wanda Group and the others said in a joint release. Other investors include electronics retailer Suning Commerce Group and fellow property developer Sunac Holdings Ltd.  This month, Tencent signed a partnership agreement with French retailer Carrefour S.A. and a local supermarket chain, agreeing to take a stake in Carrefour\u2019s Chinese entity. In Shanghai, it also is testing an unmanned pop-up store with consumers using mobile payments to complete the sale.  JD will invest 5 billion yuan into Wanda Commercial Properties Co., the company said in a regulatory filing. JD took part in the deal to create multichannel approaches to shopping, a JD spokesman said.  In announcing the investment, Wanda said the aim was to speed up the adoption of its \u201casset-light\u201d model that would allow it to earn income from managing properties instead of owning them.  Wanda Commercial raised 34.5 billion Hong Kong dollars ($4.34 billion) from private investors to delist the company\u2019s Hong Kong shares in 2016, in the biggest take-private deal on the city\u2019s exchange. Wanda\u2019s aim was to relist the company in China, where big appetite from retail investors helps companies fetch higher valuations.  Last year, Wanda came under fire from Beijing for its aggressive overseas deal-making, which curtailed the company\u2019s ability to pay for overseas acquisitions and repay debt. To shore up its balance sheet, the company since has sold billions of dollars in assets both in China and abroad. Wanda\u2019s Hong Kong-listed unit said Monday in a regulatory filing that it was selling two Australian real-estate projects as part of those efforts.  Wanda faced a September deadline to relist Wanda Commercial or repay investors in full plus interest of up to 10%, a person familiar with the transaction said.  The investors\u2019 stake, which collectively equals 14%, will be transferred to the new group and could clear a path for regulators to approve Wanda Commercial\u2019s relisting in Shanghai. The sale also represents a 22% premium over what investors originally paid to delist the stake.

So far, none of the new units have become significant businesses. Alphabet executives have stressed many of the bets will need years to pay off and only a few need to succeed for the Alphabet strategy to work.

We\u2019re back after taking a short break over the Easter weekend. The Villanova Wildcats stormed to victory against the Michigan Wolverines to win their second college basketball championship in three seasons Monday night. TBS\u2019s ad sales team was probably celebrating, too. The average cost for a 30-second spot during the game ranged between $1.4 million and $1.7 million, a 3% jump over last year, according to media-research firm SQAD.  Plenty of popcorn-grabbing moments over the past few days as our tech overlords took potshots at each other. Apple CEO Tim Cook threw some barbs in Facebook\u2019s direction last week during a taping of an MSNBC interview with Recode\u2019s Kara Swisher slated to air April 6. Mr. Cook called for more privacy regulation and said he\u2019d never be in the same situation Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is currently in because Apple\u2019s business model relies on the sale of devices and services users, rather than essentially selling users to advertisers. Mr. Zuckerberg fired back in a must-read interview with Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein, saying Mr Cook\u2019s comments were \u201cextremely glib and not at all aligned with the truth.\u201d The killer quote: \u201cIt\u2019s important that we don\u2019t all get Stockholm syndrome and let the companies that work hard to charge you more convince you that they actually care more about you.\u201d Sharing\u2019s caring!  \u2014Chickity Check Yo Self Before You Wreck Yo Self\u2014  You\u2019ll remember Facebook last week said it was curbing the information it exchanges with data brokers and shutting down its \u201cPartner Categories\u201d ad targeting tool. Now changes are coming to Custom Audiences, where marketers upload their own customer data lists in order to target them with ads across Facebook\u2019s platform. TechCrunch reported Facebook is building a more prominent permission tool for advertisers to certify they have permission to use the data they\u2019re uploading and that it\u2019ll prevent the sharing of Custom Audiences data between different Business Manager accounts. Facebook\u2019s policies always stated that advertisers should have consent for the data they\u2019re uploading, but by making those terms more obvious it\u2019s hoping to prevent the kind of illicit data sharing we saw in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. And, like everyone else, Facebook\u2019s also preparing for the EU\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation that goes into effect in May. Meanwhile, in a similar vein, Facebook-owned Instagram has suddenly limited how much data some developers can collect from its API, Recode reported.  The Magic Number  Google-owner Alphabet reports its quarterly earnings on April 23, but this time it\u2019s different, Bloomberg reports. Google has long tracked the amount of money it makes from ads using \u201ccost-per-click,\u201d a metric that\u2019s closely watched by analysts. That makes a lot more sense on search than on the network of third-party sites it sells ads across because most advertisers tend to buy display and video ads based on impressions rather than clicks. So, in Q1, Alphabet will report on percentage changes in impressions and cost-per-impressions metrics for its Network business. Speaking of impressions, YouTube is launching a new \u201cTrueView\u201d ad product that advertisers will pay for on an impression (CPM) basis, even if users skip at the five-second mark, Ad Age reports. What\u2019s the sell here? The blog post announcing \u201cTrueView for Reach\u201d suggests that brands that are good at getting their message across in just a few seconds can potentially reach more people and drive down their CPMs.  Laura, Can\u2019t You Give Me Some Time  Fox News has responded to advertisers\u2019 withdrawals from \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d over a tweet by the show\u2019s host, Laura Ingraham, that mocked Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg. Ms. Ingraham, who apologized, is now off on a scheduled vacation and due to return next Monday, according to Fox News Co-President Jack Abernethy. Mr. Abernethy said in a statement, \u201cWe cannot allow voices to be censored by agenda-driven intimidation efforts,\u201d reports the Los Angeles Times. As the Wrap reported, \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d had just 7 minutes of paid commercial time on Friday, down from an average of 14 minutes 33 seconds between January 1 and March 28, according to data from Kantar Media. The show lost five of its top 20 advertisers: Bayer, Hulu, Johnson & Johnson, Liberty Mutual and Wayfair. What\u2019s not clear is whether the network is taking a financial hit or whether advertisers have simply shifted to other Fox News shows. A source told Variety that Fox News is accommodating sponsors who want to move their ads elsewhere in the schedule. (Reminder: Fox News parent 21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp share common ownership.)  Sumnertime Blues  CBS and Viacom are advancing in their merger talks. So who will have the final say on whether to do a deal? Sumner Redstone, the 94-year-old mogul whose health has declined so badly that he can\u2019t speak much beyond grunts, is still the most powerful figure, in theory \u2014 with an 80% voting interest in National Amusements, the holding company that itself owns nearly 80% voting stakes in Viacom and CBS. But WSJ\u2019s Keach Hagey has new details on the current chain of command: National Amusements updated its bylaws in 2016 to make clear that Mr. Redstone had a single vote among seven NAI directors in decisions tied to the Viacom and CBS stakes. That move, meant to clarify procedures partly due to questions about Mr. Redstone\u2019s mental capacity, hasn\u2019t previously been disclosed. Mr. Redstone\u2019s holding still gives him the power to replace NAI board members. A decision on whether to combine Viacom and CBS could come as soon as this month. And as Reuters first reported, CBS is close to making an all-stock offer that values Viacom below its current stock price.  Best of the rest  21st Century Fox said Tuesday it could sell British TV channel Sky News to Disney in order to ease the passage of its bid to acquire the 61% of Sky it does not already own. Its other proposed remedy is to establish Sky News as a separate company within the bigger Sky group, with an independent board and a 15-year funding guarantee.

Intel and other computer-chip and software makers are dealing with the fallout following the disclosure of two widespread hardware vulnerabilities found by cybersecurity experts. Photo: mike blake/Reuters  The sale of Intel Corp. INTC -3.16% stock by Chief Executive Brian Krzanich while the company was handling concerns about security flaws in its chips was a highly unusual move that risked attracting regulatory scrutiny, according to lawyers and analysts who follow executive stock sales.  The trade took place on Nov. 29, nearly six months after Intel was informed about the vulnerabilities, which could enable hackers to access user data in chips made by Intel and others. Mr. Krzanich sold shares and exercised stock options valued at a total of $39 million, netting him nearly $25 million, according to regulatory filings made at the time.  Word of the security flaws didn\u2019t become public until last week, sending Intel\u2019s shares down.  The timing of Mr. Krzanich\u2019s sale \u201cis really odd,\u201d said Dan O\u2019Connor, an attorney specializing in securities with the law firm Ropes & Gray. \u201cThe timing, the size, the unusual nature compared to prior sales\u2014that\u2019s going to get this a lot of scrutiny.\u201d  The trade took place under a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule that allows officers and directors of public companies to prearrange sales of specific numbers of shares at particular times. The rule prohibits insiders from setting up such transactions while possessing undisclosed information that might affect the stock price, Mr. O\u2019Connor and other securities experts said.  Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich netted nearly $25 million in the stock transaction. Photo: Getty Images  A spokesman for Intel said Mr. Krzanich\u2019s divestiture was unrelated to the chip-security issue and the sale was based on a prearranged trading program. The company declined to make Mr. Krzanich available for an interview.  Regulatory filings show that Mr. Krzanich established the divestiture plan about a month before the trade, on Oct. 30, long after Intel learned of the chip vulnerabilities in June.  Intel hasn\u2019t said when Mr. Krzanich was informed of the issue. The company declined to provide further comment.  Intel\u2019s stock was up about 20% year-to-date when Mr. Krzanich put the trading plan in place, with almost all of those gains occurring in the prior two months.  Mr. Krzanich\u2019s trade stands out because it deviated from the CEO\u2019s previous pattern of incremental sales of Intel stock, according to Ben Silverman, a researcher at InsiderScore LLC, a clearinghouse for information about trades made by corporate and institutional insiders. Using the same SEC rule for trades by company officials, the CEO had exercised options and sold shares generally at monthly or quarterly intervals in the prior two years, involving no more than 80,000 shares in any given transaction, according to Mr. Silverman\u2019s analysis.  WSJ\u2019s Joanna Stern \u2018bumps\u2019 into Intel CEO Brian Krzanich in the elevator at D.Live and asks about driverless cars and his favorite chip, to eat and to use. Photo: Andria Chamberlin for The Wall Street Journal  On Nov. 29, Mr. Krzanich sold more than 245,000 shares, nearly 50% of his unrestricted stock, reducing his unrestricted holding to 250,000 shares, the minimum set by Intel\u2019s executive-stock-ownership guidelines, according to the company\u2019s most recent proxy statement. That was an unusual move by a CEO, Mr. Silverman said. Moreover, Mr. Krzanich liquidated all his options, more than 644,000 shares valued at more than $28 million in total.  \u201cIt\u2019s not just that he sold stock knowing about the security issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThe size and selling behavior were unusual. Put those two elements together, and certainly on the surface it doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d  Mr. Silverman and other securities experts said they would expect U.S. regulators to examine Mr. Krzanich\u2019s trade to see if it violated insider-trading regulations, although such cases are difficult to win. A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment.  For an insider trade to violate the rule, the information held by Mr. Krzanich about the security vulnerabilities in Intel chips at the time he made the trade would have to be deemed material to Intel\u2019s business, the securities experts said. Intel said last week that it didn\u2019t expect the issue to have any material impact on its business.  That might be reasonable, said Doug Chia, who oversees governance issues at the Conference Board, a nonprofit business advisory group. Tech companies frequently discover security flaws, many of which are insignificant or easily fixed, he said.  Even so, other securities specialists say companies generally would want to be careful in communicating with investors about a CEO\u2019s stock sale in such circumstances.  \u201cAt first glance, it\u2019s a very unusual type of thing that shareholders and directors would want a fairly tight explanation about,\u201d said David Larcker, a professor of securities law at Stanford University. \u201cIt may be fine, but it\u2019s the kind of thing you\u2019d want to really understand and be transparent with shareholders about.\u201d  At the time of Mr. Krzanich\u2019s sale, Intel was working with chip rivals and software partners to patch the security flaws, which were built into a variety of chips including virtually all Intel processors going back more than a decade. Intel was by far the company most affected by the problem, because it has dominant market share in chips used for servers and personal computers.  The companies had planned to announce the problem and their fixes on Jan. 9, but news of the security flaws leaked earlier. Intel shares then fell over 5% total on Wednesday and Thursday. The stock rose less than 1% on Friday and closed flat at $44.74 Monday.

Intel\u2019s decision to inform Chinese technology companies about security flaws in its processors raises concerns that the information could have reached the Chinese government before being publicly divulged. Photo: steinba/EPA/Shutterstock  In initial disclosures about critical security flaws discovered in its processors, Intel Corp. INTC -3.16% notified a small group of customers, including Chinese technology companies, but left out the U.S. government, according to people familiar with the matter and some of the companies involved.  The decision raises concerns, security researchers said, as it potentially could have allowed information about the chip flaws, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown, to fall into the hands of the Chinese government before being publicly divulged. There is no evidence any information was misused, the researchers said.  Weeks after word of the flaws first surfaced, Intel\u2019s choices about who would receive advance warning continue to ripple through the security and tech industries.  The flaws were first identified in June by a member of Google\u2019s Project Zero security team. Intel had planned to make the discovery public on Jan. 9\u2014people working to protect systems from hacks often hold off on announcements while fixes are devised\u2014but sped up its timetable when the news became widely known on Jan. 3, a day after U.K. website the Register wrote about the flaws.  Because the flaws can be leveraged to sneak sensitive data out of the cloud, information about them would be of great interest to any intelligence-gathering agency, said Jake Williams, president of the security company Rendition Infosec LLC and a former National Security Agency employee. In the past, Chinese state-linked hackers have exploited software vulnerabilities to get leverage on their targets or expand surveillance.  It is a \u201cnear certainty\u201d Beijing was aware of the conversations between Intel and its Chinese tech partners, because authorities there routinely monitor all such communications, Mr. Williams said.  Representatives from China\u2019s ministry in charge of information technology didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The country\u2019s foreign ministry has in the past said it is \u201cresolutely opposed\u201d to cyberhacking in any form.  An Intel spokesman declined to identify the companies it briefed before the scheduled Jan. 9 announcement. The company wasn\u2019t able to tell everyone it had planned to, including the U.S. government, because the news was made public earlier than expected, he said.  Intel\u2019s tricky path\u2014inform enough big customers to head off significant damage while keeping the information as contained as possible to limit potential leaks\u2014continues to weigh on smaller companies that weren\u2019t given an early nod.  Joyent Inc., a U.S.-based cloud-services provider owned by Samsung Electronics Co. , is still playing catch-up, said Bryan Cantrill, the company\u2019s chief technology officer.  \u201cOther folks had a six-month head start,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re scrambling.\u201d  In the months before the flaws were publicly disclosed, Intel worked on fixes with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google unit as well as \u201ckey\u201d computer makers and cloud-computing companies, Intel said in an emailed statement to The Wall Street Journal.  An official at the Department of Homeland Security said staffers learned of the chip flaws from the Jan. 3 news reports. The department is often informed of bug discoveries in advance of the public, and it acts as an authoritative source for information on how to address them.  \u201cWe certainly would have liked to have been notified of this,\u201d the official said.  The NSA was similarly in the dark, according to Rob Joyce, the White House\u2019s top cybersecurity official. In a message posted Jan. 13 to Twitter, he said the NSA \u201cdid not know about these flaws.\u201d A White House spokesman declined to comment further, referring instead to the tweet.  Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group Ltd. LNVGY -2.69% was among the large tech companies, including Microsoft Corp. , Amazon.com Inc. and ARM Holdings in the U.K., that were notified of the flaws beforehand.  Lenovo was able to issue a statement Jan. 3 advising customers on the flaws because of \u201cthe work we\u2019d done ahead of that date with industry processor and operating system partners,\u201d a spokeswoman said in an email.  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.93% , China\u2019s top seller of cloud-computing services, also was notified ahead of time, according to a person familiar with the company.  A spokeswoman for Alibaba\u2019s cloud unit declined to comment on when the company was informed. She said any idea that the company might have shared information with Chinese authorities was \u201cspeculative and baseless.\u201d  A Lenovo spokeswoman said Intel\u2019s information was protected by a nondisclosure agreement.  Despite the security concerns, an early heads up to a select number of large global companies made sense, said Dave Aitel, chief executive of Immunity Inc., a company that sells security services. \u201cThey\u2019re going to tell as few people as possible\u201d to contain possible leaks, he said.  Because they had early warning, Microsoft, Google and Amazon were able to release statements soon after news of the flaws leaked out saying their cloud-computing customers were largely protected.  Smaller competitors, though, continue to struggle. DigitalOcean Inc., a cloud-services seller, said Jan. 19 it was still testing a fix for its customers. Rackspace Inc. said last Wednesday it has several teams working on a fix. The cloud company earlier in January told customers it understood the situation \u201ccan be frustrating.\u201d  The DHS also stumbled with its initial guidance. The agency\u2019s Computer Emergency Response Team first linked to an advisory stating the only way to \u201cfully remove\u201d the flaws was by replacing the chip. CERT now advises users instead to patch their systems.  The DHS should have been looped in early on to help coordinate the flaws\u2019 disclosure, Joyent\u2019s Mr. Cantrill said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why CERT would not be your first stop,\u201d he said.

WSJ's David Pierce has a few tricks and tips to pull yourself back into the real world. Photo/Video: Emily Prapuolenis/The Wall Street Journal  When smartphones came to steal our attention, we never had a chance. Even in the rare moments we manage to put them down, they buzz incessantly, begging us to come back.  It\u2019s fine for phones to be engrossing when we\u2019re bored on a layover. More often they should help us work or exercise or find a Starbucks , then get out of the way.  Now, more than a decade into the smartphone era, investors, activists and customers alike have begun to push phone makers, especially Apple Inc., AAPL -2.56% to find a way to solve phone addiction.  The feature we need already exists: It\u2019s called Do Not Disturb. Whether you use an iPhone or an Android device, you have a one-tap way to shut your phone up. Do Not Disturb should be every smartphone user\u2019s best friend and saving grace. Instead, it\u2019s a relic of a long-gone era, a feature that doesn\u2019t work the way we do.  The iPhone\u2019s \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 feature shuts off nearly everything. You can engage it manually or schedule your silence ahead of time. Photo: David Pierce/The Wall Street Journal  Apple launched Do Not Disturb in 2012 to keep your phone from waking you up in the middle of the night. When you tap the moon icon, your phone instantly shuts up. Your notifications are visible if you wake up your phone, but it won\u2019t buzz or light up automatically. There are only small nuances: You can name contacts who can call you\u2014no texts get through when Do Not Disturb is engaged\u2014or allow anyone who calls twice to buzz through on the second call.  Last year, the company launched Do Not Disturb While Driving, which engages when your phone connects to your car stereo or its motion sensors detect driving. It allows alarms and timers\u2014and Apple Maps navigation\u2014but generally keeps the screen dark. Anyone who messages you can receive an automatic response.  The problem is that this dichotomy\u2014you\u2019re either on or off, zero or 100\u2014doesn\u2019t actually represent how people use their phones. When you\u2019re sleeping, you might want total quiet. But what about at work, when you\u2019re still reachable but trying to focus on your presentation instead of incessant ESPN updates? Or when the people you care most about would rather use WhatsApp or Snapchat, instead of calling you? Turning on Do Not Disturb is like taking your landline phone off the hook to keep it from ringing.  Apple\u2019s \u2018Do Not Disturb While Driving\u2019 allows you to auto-respond to texts so your friends won\u2019t wonder why you\u2019re not replying. Photo: David Pierce/The Wall Street Journal  Do Not Disturb should have a sort of volume meter, from 0 to 10. When you\u2019re bored on the couch, turn the knob all the way up and let the distracting notifications flow. When you\u2019re asleep go to 0: silence is golden. In between, users ought to be able to control what gets through and when.  At work you need buzzes for your calendar, email and Slack, but would rather not have Candy Crush luring you back in before lunchtime. There should be an \u201cI\u2019m in a meeting\u201d setting, and a \u201cGet me out of this meeting\u201d one, too.  Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google does this better. Android\u2019s Do Not Disturb, launched in 2014, has a Total Silence mode, but also offers Priority Mode. With that engaged, only the apps you\u2019ve handpicked can buzz your phone. My friends can message me on all the apps I use, but Starbucks can\u2019t tell me about deals, and Twitter can\u2019t suck me back into my timeline. Android also allows you to let calendar notifications or reminders through the Do Not Disturb wall.  Google could do more; Apple could do much more. Users should be able to set their own rules. Studies have shown that when people reduce notifications, they worry they\u2019re missing important things. By ensuring you\u2019re seeing the things that matter, and shutting up the (many, many more) things that don\u2019t, Do Not Disturb could address this.

They could differentiate between morning and evening, weekend and weekdays. Android can engage Do Not Disturb in sync with your calendar events, but it can\u2019t tell whether you\u2019re bored in the dentist\u2019s waiting room or stressing in a job interview. Devices could use their knowledge of your location, calendar and activity to figure out exactly how much you can be bothered.  Apple and Google are the only companies in a position to make this work at the system level.

Spokesmen for both companies also pointed to notification controls as another way to manage your influx. I don\u2019t see it that way. Certainly, you should control which apps can notify you and how, but there\u2019s no \u201cwhen\u201d notification setting. What users really need is an easy way to receive notifications from partners, bosses and close friends\u2014and from any app. Why constantly tweak each app\u2019s notifications? We should be able to make the rules once, with one tool, and not worry about it again.  When you really need to focus, of course, there\u2019s one feature even more powerful than Do Not Disturb. Just turn your phone off. But then how will you navigate home? Or read your book? Or plan dinner, play \u201cAlto\u2019s Adventure\u201d or check your fantasy team?

AMZN -3.20% is scheduled to announce its fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what you need to know:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Amazon to earn $1.85 a share, compared with $1.54 a year ago. The company has forecast an operating income range between $300 million and $1.65 billion, compared with income of $1.26 billion a year ago.  REVENUE FORECAST: Quarterly revenue of $59.83 billion is forecast by the analysts, compared with $43.74 billion a year ago. Amazon said it expected sales of between $56 billion and $60.5 billion for the quarter, which includes growth from its acquisition of Whole Foods.  WHAT TO WATCH:  \u2014HOLIDAYS: Amazon lately has been demonstrating a little more fiscal discipline, something that may pay off with record profitability in its all-important fourth quarter. Already, industry numbers are indicating a positive holiday season for retailers as consumers spent more, something that should benefit Amazon, which has a 40%-plus share of online shopping.  \u2014WHOLE FOODS: Amazon acquired Whole Foods in August, and the fourth quarter is the first full quarter of reporting. Amazon has so far added lockers for package pickups and lowered prices. Analysts will expect some evidence of whether it is paying off. For roughly one month in the third quarter, the grocery chain contributed about $1.28 billion in sales and $21 million in operating income.  \u2014HQ2: Executives may provide an update on its search for a second headquarters. The company earlier this month narrowed its list to 20 from 238. The stakes are high: Amazon has said it plans to create about 50,000 jobs and invest $5 billion over nearly 20 years.  \u2014HEALTH CARE: Amazon on Tuesday said it was joining JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to form a new company focusing on lowering U.S. health-care costs. The companies hope the entire health-care project could at a minimum save them hundreds of millions of dollars, according to a person familiar with the matter. Amazon has more than 300,000 employees in the U.S. after adding Whole Foods, and those benefits are costly. Expect analysts to ask for more clarity on potential cost savings.

Food retailers are responsible for food waste worth some $18 billion a year, roughly double the sector\u2019s profit from food sales.  More investors are pushing companies to change food-waste and packaging practices that they see as a potential drag on profits in a low-margin business. Many companies are responding.

(Originally published Dec. 5, 2016)  Amazon announced the new Go store with fanfare in December 2016, and said it would open to the public in early 2017. The opening was delayed, however, as the technology proved more difficult to master than expected, with glitches occurring when too many people were in the store or were moving too quickly, The Wall Street Journal reported in March 2017.  Amazon didn\u2019t explain the delay at the time. According to Mr. Kumar, while the store was originally expected to quickly open to the public to gain extra traffic needed for testing, the company decided it had enough employees to teach the system instead.  That training helped Amazon Go\u2019s technology better identify objects and follow the different speeds and patterns of shoppers, tasks Mr. Kumar described as particularly challenging in a crowd.  Some people \u201cmove in very unpredictable ways,\u201d Mr. Kumar said. \u201cYou\u2019re always bending down, you\u2019re examining items, you\u2019re picking things up.\u201d  The Go experiment shows how Amazon is trying to transform shopping in physical stores after decades of pioneering retail online. Since 2015, the company also has added more than a dozen Amazon Books stores, which encourage customers to pull out their phones to scan covers for prices.  In August, Amazon completed a $13.5 billion deal to buy grocery chain Whole Foods, adding 470 brick-and-mortar stores to its portfolio overnight.  Amazon Go\u2019s technology uses cameras throughout the store to track shoppers once they are inside, though it doesn\u2019t use facial recognition, Mr. Kumar said. A customer entering the store scans his or her phone and then becomes represented internally as a 3-D object to the system. Cameras also are pointed at the shelves to determine interactions with goods.  Shoppers browse the items at the Amazon Go store in Seattle during its employee-only testing phase.

Adding to the complexity, when customers pick up products, they usually cover the distinguishing aspects of the label with their hands.  Some store associates are still needed. For example, customers purchasing alcohol must show identification.  Former Amazon executives say it likely would be difficult to scale the system to track people in a bigger store, and that it could take years to make it work in a larger store footprint. Still, they say it may make sense one day for Amazon to try to implement the technology more widely\u2014either via additional Go stores or even in Whole Foods.  Mr. Kumar said there are currently no plans to introduce the technology in Whole Foods. He added, however, that every project should be expandable.  \u201cWe have this unwritten rule that whatever it is you\u2019re building, you have to be able to scale it so that it covers significantly amount of more load than what you would normally ever expect,\u201d Mr. Kumar said.
