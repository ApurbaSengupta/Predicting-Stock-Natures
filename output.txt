Tesla  The US National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending two investigators to examine the crash of a Tesla Model S apparently traveling in semi-autonomous mode  This is the second time the safety board has probed a Tesla crash that may be linked to Autopilot.  Tesla's semi-autonomous driver assist system that handles some tasks and allows drivers under certain conditions to take their hands off the wheel.  The system requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel, and emits escalating alerts if they don't.  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Tuesday it was sending two investigators to examine the crash of a Tesla vehicle apparently traveling in semi-autonomous mode and a fire truck in California.  In a post on Twitter, the federal safety agency said the "field investigation" would examine both driver and vehicle factors in Monday's accident.  This is the second time the safety board has probed a Tesla crash that may be linked to Autopilot, Tesla's semi-autonomous driver assist system that handles some tasks and allows drivers under certain conditions to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods.  The Culver City, California fire department said in a Twitter post that on Monday an engine was struck by a Tesla "traveling at 65 mph. The driver reports the vehicle was on Autopilot. Amazingly there were no injuries."  The NTSB faulted Tesla in a prior fatal Autopilot crash.  In September, the NTSB chairman said "operational limitations" in the Tesla Model S played a "major role" in a May 2016 crash that killed a driver using the vehicle's semi-autonomous system.  The limits on the system include factors such as Tesla being unable to ensure driver attention even when the car is traveling at high speeds, ensuring Autopilot is used only on certain roads and monitoring driver engagement, NTSB said in September.  The NTSB recommended auto safety regulators and automakers take steps to ensure that semi-autonomous systems are not misused.  "System safeguards were lacking," NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said.  Tesla declined to comment Tuesday on the new probe. In September the company said, "Autopilot significantly increases safety," citing an earlier government study that suggested the system reduced the incidence of crashes.  The company has emphasized that "Autopilot is not a fully self-driving technology and drivers need to remain attentive at all times."  Joshua Brown, a 40-year-old Ohio man, was killed near Williston, Florida, when his Model S collided with a truck while it was engaged in the Autopilot mode.  The fatal incident raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.  The NTSB said Tesla could have taken further steps to prevent the system's misuse, and faulted the driver for not paying attention. The agency said the Autopilot system operated as designed but did not ensure drivers paid adequate attention.  (Writing by Tim Ahmann; editing by Eric Walsh and Cynthia Osterman)

Markets Insider  Tesla is down 5.95% Thursday, taking the stock down 17% in the past week.  If it declines another 3% it will be considered to be in a bear market.    Shares of Tesla tumbled more than 5% in trading Friday, continuing a week that has been marked by slumps for the electric car maker.  On Wednesday, the company posted a smaller-than-expected fourth quarter loss as well as a slower cash burn, but it wasn’t enough to keep the stock in the green.  The stock is nearing bear market territory, defined as a 20% drop from recent highs. Since a peak of $360.50 in January, Tesla has fallen 17.5% to $297 Friday afternoon.  Tesla has a recurring problem of missing key production deadlines, delivering just half of the cars analysts expected last month, yet its stock price until this week has generally climbed despite the delays and negative cash flow.  "2018 will be a transformative year for Tesla, with a high level of operational scaling," CEO Elon Musk said in an earnings press release. "As we ramp production of both Model 3 and our energy products while keeping tight control of operating expenses, our quarterly operating income should turn sustainably positive at some point in 2018."  Wall Street, on the other hand, isn’t quite as optimistic.  Analysts polled by Bloomberg - only a third of whom have a buy rating for the stock - give Tesla an average target price of $323, only 7% below where shares were trading Thursday morning.  "Automation fixes being done in Germany suggest that Model 3 production targets are at risk and that investors will not be surprised by such delays, which we expect will allow TSLA to push out capex payments, reducing near-term cash pressure," analyst Colin Rusch said in a note to clients Thursday.  "We expect investors will remain split on results and that shares will trade sideways as bulls remain patient on Model 3 production."  If the stock hits $288.40 - 2.9% below where shares were trading Friday afternoon - Tesla will be considered to be in a bear market.  Tesla’s stock price has gained 10% in the past year, roughly in line with the S&P 500’s similar 10% rise.

The last photo of "Starman" in Elon Musk's red Tesla Roadster as it flies toward Mars orbit. Earth is the bright crescent seen in the background. Elon Musk/SpaceX via Instagram  SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, recently launched the world's largest operational rocket on February 6.  Falcon Heavy's launch sent Musk's personal 2008 red Tesla Roadster on a voyage toward Mars orbit with a "Starman" dummy in the driver's seat.  Planetary scientists are concerned about bacterial contamination on Musk's car in case it crashes into Mars — a planet that may host alien microbes.  However, new calculations show the Tesla will most likely hit Earth, Venus, or the sun.  On February 6, SpaceX launched the world's most powerful operational rocket, called Falcon Heavy, for the first time.  The launch sent company founder Elon Musk's own red Tesla Roadster on a path that crosses the orbit of Mars. This attracted the attention of researchers worried about an eventual crash into the red planet, which would contaminate the world — and any alien microbes living there.  But planetary science researchers can now breathe a little easier, if a new study about the Roadster's fate is correct.  Musk put his Roadster on top of the 230-foot-tall rocket with a spacesuit-clad dummy named "Starman" in the driver's seat. Launching the car demonstrated Falcon Heavy's capabilities and was reportedly a backup plan for a scientific NASA or military payload.  The Roadster's short-lived yet unparalleled camera feeds, overall silliness (as Musk has described it), and far-flung path through space captured global attention.  But not all of it has proved welcome.  SpaceX founder Elon Musk in a press conference after the launch of Falcon Heavy. Dave Mosher/Business Insider The Planetary Society's Jason Davis bemoaned the planetary protection risk posed by Musk's un-sterilized car crashing into Mars and sprinkling debris coated with bacteria, viruses, and fungi all over the planet. The reason: alien microbes may be hiding out in Martian soil.  "NASA goes to great lengths sterilizing spacecraft designed to land on Mars, in order to make sure there's no chance of Earthly microbes contaminating the surface," Davis wrote in a post before launch. "Such a contamination could harm existing life and muddle scientific efforts to search for said life."  But that risk now appears minimal, according to a new scientific study titled "The random walk of cars and their collision probabilities with planets."  Three researchers at the University of Toronto posted their paper on Tuesday to the pre-print arXiv server and submitted to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.  Where and when Musk's Tesla will most likely crash  A chart showing the location of Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster in space on February 15, 2018. WhereIsTesla.com  Hanno Rein, an astrophysicist and lead author of the study, said the roughly week-long research came out of advanced orbital-mechanics computer simulations.  "Earth is the most likely place the car will crash, followed by Venus, and then the sun," Rein told Business Insider, and likely within 10 million years — not hundreds of millions or possibly billions, as Musk has suggested.  To arrive at that conclusion, Rein and his colleagues started with orbital tracking data for the Roadster posted by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Then they plugged that data into simulation software called REBOUND, which allowed them to fast-forward the car's likeliest orbital paths through the solar system over the next few million years.  That data suggest Musk's car will fly out past Mars orbit, spending very little time there, and then swing back around, over and over again.  "Every 30 years or so, it will come relatively close to the Earth," Rein said, where it will get a gravitational tug. "This causes a change of a few percent in some of the orbital parameters. The distance to the sun would change slightly, for example, and the orbit's eccentricity."  The calculations suggest the Roadster will come within one Earth-moon distance of our planet within 100 years, possibly enabling new Earth-based telescope views.  Elon Musk's red Tesla Roadster before launching on a Falcon Heavy rocket toward Mars orbit. Elon Musk/SpaceX; Instagram  But after its third flyby, Rein said the Roadster will take on an increasingly chaotic and somewhat unpredictable path through space. That's because those gravitational tugs near Earth's orbit — where the car will spend most of its time compared to other bodies in the system — can "lead to a huge change afterward," Rein said.  By running hundreds of different simulations of those orbital possibilities out to 3.5 million years from today, Rein and his colleagues figured out there's a 6% chance of the Roadster crashing into Earth and a 2.5% chance of crashing into Venus during that time.  "We've not seen any single collision with Mars in 240 simulations, though we continue to run them and see what happens," Rein said. "The likely outcome is that it will crash, in tens of millions of years, into Earth or Venus or the sun."  Astronomers are tracking the car in space  Two other astronomers — Gianluca Masi of The Virtual Telescope Project and Michael Schwartz of Tenagra Observatories, Ltd. — also used JPL data to track the Roadster.  Last week, they managed to photograph the car flying beyond the moon moving at a speed of roughly 25,000 miles per hour.  The vehicle is reflective enough to see through a telescope, at least for now, leading to what they called a "stunning" animation of several images.  Masi said he and Schwartz will continue to track the Roadster for as long as possible.  "The object is slowly fading: you can image it now with a 6" or so scope," Masi told Business Insider in an email. "In one month or so it will need a much larger scope to be imaged (16" or larger)."

Tesla Model 3. Bryan Logan/Business Insider  More Tesla Model 3s are rolling into Tesla retail stores nationwide, but lingering production issues are hampering the company.  A CNBC report published Thursday alleged that part of the Model 3's battery was being assembled by hand as recently as mid-December.  Customer deliveries are underway, but the "production hell" that CEO Elon Musk previously warned about is having a real impact.  Tesla missed its production targets in Q3 and Q4 2017, and cut its projections in half for the first quarter of 2018.  Tesla Model 3s are still rolling into the company's retail stores nationwide even as Tesla deals with the fallout from new reports about production challenges at its Gigafactory battery plan in Nevada.  Model 3s began showing up at Tesla stores in Texas and Arizona among other places this week. The company brought the entry level luxury electric car to its showroom for the first time in Los Angeles and Palo Alto earlier this month.  A CNBC report published Thursday cited current and former Tesla employees who alleged that part of the Model 3's batteries were being assembled by hand as recently as mid-December because of ongoing issues at the Gigafactory. A Tesla spokesperson called the claims "extremely misinformed and misleading" in an email to Business Insider.  Customer deliveries of the Model 3 have begun, but the "production hell" that CEO Elon Musk previously warned about is having a real impact.  Tesla missed its production targets in Q3 and Q4 2017, and cut its projections in half for the first quarter of 2018. The company had said last year that it expected to make 20,000 Model 3s per month by December 2017.  The Model 3 is Tesla's first offering in the entry level luxury segment.  Despite the production challenges, Tesla set a sales record for 2017, delivering 101,312 Model S and Model X vehicles alone during the year. It was the first time Tesla crossed the 100,000-vehicles-sold benchmark in 14 years.

http://www.businessinsider.com/why-apple-should-buy-tesla-2018-1
Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images  The idea that Apple should buy Tesla has been floated many times.  Apple now has more than enough cash coming back to the US to do the deal.  Tesla needs to be saved from its delusional idea about the company's future growth — and Apple needs to be saved from the disaster of its car project.  Last November, Rolling Stone published a profile of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, written by Neil Strauss, a neo-gonzo journalist who made his name with a book about pickup culture. And in that interview Musk made a confession.  "I wish we could be private with Tesla," Musk told Strauss. "It actually makes us less efficient to be a public company."  Tesla has been public since its 2010 IPO and since then the stock has risen from about $20 a share to nearly $400 at one point in 2017. The company's market cap is now close to $60 billion. Investors who jumped in seven years ago have enjoyed a return of nearly 1,200%.  Musk might be the only person who wishes Tesla were private. Even short-sellers, recently clobbered by Tesla's surge, have been delighted when the stock has gone through one of its periodic swoons of $100 in a few months. And ironically, Musk's next ten years of compensation are now completely tied to Tesla's market performance, which the board of directors thinks can yield a $650-billion market cap.  That's delusional. In many ways, it sets Musk up for both continued inefficiency — a lot of second-guessing about investments in automation, for example, at the expense of hitting production targets — and potentially epic failure. It also represents a radical formulation of shareholder value theory.  Tesla is wildly overvalued, and what it needs now isn't a fatter stock price but rather an ability to satisfy customers. For the Model 3 mass-market vehicle, currently stalled amid production bottlenecks, Tesla has 400,000 mostly unfulfilled pre-orders.  Apple buying Tesla is an idea that always seems to be on the table  Apple CEO Tim Cook. Getty  In the past, there's been talk about somebody buying Tesla. Usually, Apple is the one that gets everybody's heart racing. I've shot down this idea several times. But with the announcement of Musk's new pay package, I think Tesla needs to be rescued from itself. And that Musk should get his wish.  Tesla is worth so much that there aren't very many companies able to buy the automaker. And Tesla going truly private would be too much of a reversal of history as well as a financial improbability, although if the bottom falls out some investors might someday snap up what's left of Tesla on the cheap.  Apple, thanks to the new tax bill, will repatriate over $250 billion is cash that it has been keeping overseas. Even after paying taxes on it, at the reduced corporate rate, it will have arguably too much left over. It could easily wind up going into share buybacks or a dividend, or Apple could continue its pattern of making small acquisitions.  Or the company, which is sitting on a mature iPhone business that mints the profits but could be looking at more severe growth headwinds in coming years, could swing for the fences and get a piece of the multi-trillion global transportation industry. If Tim Cook agrees with the Tesla board that the company will be worth $650 billion in a decade, then buying Tesla now would be a staggering bargain.  The obvious question is, "Who would be Tesla's CEO?" Musk's pay package is designed to ensure that it's him, an extreme evolution of addressing the "great man" risk that companies led by visionary founders face. But Musk is also running SpaceX and he's on the verge of launching a huge rocket that could pave the way for a Mars mission. Dealing with Tesla's difficulties could be seen as a needless distraction.  That said, Musk could remain CEO of Tesla as an independent business unit of Apple, while Tim Cook would run the entire show (Musk could also relinquish the CEO title but continue as chairman of the board). In a way, Cook isn't really a CEO in the Musk/Steve Jobs vein anyway. He's more like a mega-COO.  And that's just what Tesla actually needs right now. If it was Jobs who rescued Apple and put it on the path that led to the iPod and the iPhone, it was Cook who turned the company into the profit-making colossus it has become. The guy is a supply-chain genius. Making stuff is his bag. And at the moment, Tesla is struggling mightily to make stuff, falling well behind its ambitious production targets for the Model 3 mass-market vehicle.  Tesla would also witness its cash-burn challenges — over $1 billion per quarter — vanish. Apple could fund losses for years.  Tesla could help Apple get into the car business The Apple Car project isn't going well. Apple  Apple has a history of falling into innovations troughs. It's in one now, following the monumental success of the iPhone. The Apple Watch hasn't been a gamechanger, and the company is chasing Amazon on smart speakers. Apple clearly wants to do something in the transportation space, but thus far its efforts have been at best confused and at worst pathetic.  Buying Tesla would change that overnight. The Apple Car, really, is a Tesla car anyway. The whole philosophy behind Tesla's vehicles, and especially the ultra-minimalist Model 3, is Apple-esque. The wait for the Apple Car would be immediately over.  And that would enable Apple to focus on bringing to Tesla what Apple's engineers and designers are now probably working on: an entirely new vehicle interface — an operating system for the car of the future.  Tesla has aspects of such a system in place, from over-the-air software updates to an increasing focus on single screens for all vehicle operations. Apple would enhance and unify these components and transform them into something unexpected. This is Apple's mojo: take something that works and make it much, much better.  Missing out on a mega-return — but one that isn't likely  Tesla market cap has become epic. Andy Kiersz/Business Insider  For investors, of course, Apple buying Tesla would eliminate any chance of a mega-return. But I think the odds are low that the 1,000%-plus payback of the past seven years will be matched by another 1,000% surge over the next ten years (Tesla is, after all, 14 years old — hardly a startup). If Tesla stays public, stockholders will also have to put up with numerous, diluting capital raises and the ever-present threat that Tesla's lack of cash and debt burden will lead to a bankruptcy.  If Apple bought Tesla, the carmaker's growth would be piped into Apple shares, and Tesla investors would certainly get a premium for their holdings, as Apple can afford to overpay. I don't even think that government regulators would have issues with the merger. Sure, Apple would be buying the dominant electric-car manufacturer. But as of 2018, the EV market makes up only 1% of global sales.  I would have stuck to my guns on the foolishness of an Apple acquisition of Tesla were it not for the reckless pay package that Tesla concocted for Musk. But I now think that Tesla is fueling a dangerous idea about the company's capabilities. Somebody needs to save Tesla from its hubris. That somebody is Apple.

http://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-showroom-and-mercedes-dealership-comparison-pictures-2018-4
Tesla's Model S Mark Matousek / Business Insider  I visited a Tesla showroom and Mercedes-Benz dealership in New York City to observe the differences between their sales models.  Tesla's store used innovative design strategies and revealed an eagerness to sell a vision of the brand beyond its vehicles.  The Mercedes-Benz dealership took a more traditional, less expansive approach to selling cars and its brand.  As established automakers move toward electrification, Tesla will compete more directly with traditional luxury brands like Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz.  Until now, Tesla has had limited competition in the fully-electric luxury space, but that will change in the next decade as auto companies plan to electrify a larger percentage of their offerings. As that happens, Tesla will have new challenges to face, and the viability of its unique sales model will become clearer.  Unlike most auto companies, Tesla sells its cars to consumers directly, rather than licensing its brand to independent dealerships. That gives Tesla more control over how it presents its vehicles and interacts with customers over time, but it would also make it more difficult and costly to achieve the kind of scale some of its competitors have. And Tesla has fought legal battles for the right to sell its vehicles directly to consumers in some states, like Connecticut and New Mexico, where it's currently prohibited from doing so.  Tesla's stores also look different than traditional car dealerships, using minimalist designs that echo innovative retail companies like Apple and Warby Parker. Tesla's stores could end up influencing how other auto companies sell their cars — or remain high-profile outliers.  I visited a Tesla showroom and Mercedes-Benz dealership in New York City to see the differences between how a relatively new and established luxury brand sell their cars. My time in each revealed contrasting sales models that spoke to the fundamental differences between Tesla and some of its competitors.  Here's what I saw.
